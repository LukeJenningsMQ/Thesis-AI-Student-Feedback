22,76,1207,"effect of al on communications, content creation, business, and the possible repercussions. abstract the effect of alon communications, content creation, and business is both significant and far reaching. content creators are using al to rapidly generate art [1], posters, code and much more. businesses are using al to automate processes, make better decisions, and improve their products and services [2]. in the future, al will transform how businesses operate and compete. although there are negatives to al as well some argue that using al to push products and more importantly, manipulating social media recommendations to do so, will lead to people being only exposed to information and opinions that agree with their own. this also leads to concerns that al will make it easier to create fake news, spread misinformation and exploit people on mass scales. as al gets better at understanding and responding to natural language, it could also get better at manipulating it, making it possible for al powered bots to convincingly impersonate real people and spread disinformation or propaganda. thesis statement al will be used to streamline not only robotics and automation, but supplement tasks that are often thought of creative and or personal in nature, including managing communications autonomously, creating art, and creating all types of personalised content. it is already having a massive effect on our online lives, and its presence will only further encroach on our real lives. although in the end, with all the benefits this will is bringing, this may come at a cost. use of al in graphical content creation and art there are many ways in which artificial intelligence can be used to create or improve art and content. for example, al can be used to generate new ideas or concepts for artworks, to create or improve digital artwork, or to help select and curate content for publication. additionally, al can be used to analyse and interpret data from artworks or other sources of information, in order to generate new insights or to improve understanding of existing artworks. depending on the al used, al created art or content could potentially be more realistic or lifelike than those created by humans, depending on the sophistication of the al used, although be formulated in a fraction of the time that of which an artist or graphic designer would take. there is definitely an odd stigma around al created art, although as a tool for rapidly creating and formulating all kinds of graphical content, there is nothing like it. . effect of al on communications the effect of artificial intelligence (al) on email and communications is both positive and negative. as al begins to learn and understand the preferences and needs of individual users, it will be able to take on more and more of the burden of communication related content creation. al has the potential to accurately reply to messages and filter summarize necessary information [3] that is being sent to us. this will free up time to focus on higher level tasks and concurrently allow us to communicate effectively with far more people during our day to day lives. additionally, al created content will likely be more accurate and tailored to users than content created by humans, due to its ability to accurately reference previous content that was created, liked or selected by the user. additionally, al will be able to provide you with insights into your work schedule and habits, and suggest ways to improve your efficiency [4]. on the negative side (who knew, giving robots agency over our lives might cause issues), al can also be used to create more effective advertisement, spam email and phishing scams [5]. it can also be used to gather information about you without your knowledge or consent and learn your preferences, personally tailoring these scams and advertisements to more likely empty your pockets, and possibly impact your life in a major way. some argue that using al to push products and more importantly, manipulating social media recommendations to do so, will lead to the development of echo chambers online, where people are only exposed to information and opinions that agree with their own. this could limit the free flow of ideas and make it harder for people to understand different points of view. another concern is that al will make it easier for people to create fake news and spread misinformation. al can be used to generate realistic looking audio [6], images and videos, which could be used to create misleading or outright false content. some also worry that as al gets better at understanding and responding to natural language, it will also get better at manipulating it. this could make it possible for al powered bots to convincingly impersonate real people and spread disinformation or propaganda en masse. . effect of al on business the impact of artificial intelligence (al) on business is already making itself extremely apparent. businesses are using al to automate processes, make better decisions, and improve their products and services. in the future, al will transform how businesses operate and compete. alis already having a major impact on businesses across a wide range of industries. in the automotive industry, al is being used to develop autonomous vehicles. in healthcare, al is being used to diagnose diseases and to personalize treatments. in the financial sector, al is being used to detect fraud and to trade stocks. al is also changing how businesses are organized. in many cases, al is eliminating the need for human employees altogether. for example, chatbots can handle customer service tasks, and robots using al to filter out specific information, can assemble products. this is leading to a new wave of "" �automation companies""� that are built around al technologies. for many businesses, this allows an opportunity for an extreme rise in productivity if utilized correctly. with this newfound productivity, the business can then redirect more resources into other parts of the business such as research and development or marketing to attract more customers, in the end possibly multiplying profits by extreme margins. the implementation of al can also lead to businesses discovering new ways of doing things which can lead to an increase in innovation. businesses can use al to automatically target a larger audience with precision and without fear of human error, and use al to create personalized advertisements for said audiences. despite all of these advantages, there are some disadvantages that need to be taken into consideration when implementing al into society and the economy. the first and most concerning disadvantage is job losses. with the implementation of al, there will be a large number of jobs lost since al will be taking over tasks that were once done by people. conclusion al is already beginning to have a significant effect on communications, content creation, and business. in the future, al will have an even greater impact on these areas, as well as on other aspects of our lives. although there are some negatives to al, with proper preparation and countermeasures, the positives outweigh the negatives massively. al if used correctly, will help usher humanity into a new era of productivity not only in robotics and automation, but our personal lives and communications. . references [1] https. impakter.com art made by ai wins fine arts competition #:~:text=an artwork made by

21,24,1158,"james webb space telescope abstract. the hubble and spitzer space telescopes have been scientifically succeeded by the james webb space telescope. a huge (6.6m) cold (sdk) telescope launched into orbit around the second earth sun lagrange point. it is a collaboration between nasa and the european and canadian space agencies. jwst s science goals include the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies in the early universe, as well as the chemical, morphological, and dynamical evolution of galaxies and the development of stars and planetary systems. the goals have been expanded to encompass research into dark energy, dark matter, active galactic nuclei, exoplanets, and solar system objects. the near infrared camera, near infrared multi object spectrograph, and near infrared imager and slitless spectrograph will span the wavelength range 0.6 to s microns, while the mid infrared instrument will cover both imaging and spectroscopy from 5 to 28.5 microns. the james webb space telescope is an infrared observatory orbiting the sun about 1 million miles from earth to find the first galaxies that formed in the early universe and to see stars forming planetary systems launched in dec 25, 2021. . introduction. space is one place every kid dreamt about discovering and surfing into it, but our ideas and understanding was not fully enough to conquer it and reach further than the moon(earth). introducing, james webb space telescope which is an exploration powerhouse and an engineering marvel machine which led us to see beyond our imagination into deep space. it utilised to travel back in time to investigate the first galaxies that formed and to see into the atmospheres of planets orbiting stars. this is the largest and most complicated space telescope ever built. since human first time crossing the earth atmosphere in 1961, our technology and physis understanding helped us discover what seemed impossible, in which helped for the interplay between culture and technological innovation. and that will change our understating of the universe and our place in it. like how our solar system was formed or is there any different life beside us or are we just unique. pic.1 james webb telescope . body. to start with, it's useful to know what happened in the early universe, before the first stars formed, to better grasp what the webb telescope will research. the big bang created the cosmos, time, and space approximately 13.8 billion years ago. the universe was a hot, dense torrent of protons, electrons, and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up atoms, for the first few hundred thousand years. as the cosmos cooled, protons and neutrons joined to form ionised hydrogen and helium, both of which had a positive charge and eventually attracted all the negatively charged electrons. this recombination process occurred between 240,000 and 300,000 years after the big bang. [1] previously, hubble space telescope was sent to space which was a massive new telescope to probe everything from weather to different planets around our solar system, then james webb telescope was created in which was six times the size of the latter. the importance of this massive telescope with culture and technological innovation is that the ability to discover more into space in which we can see and discover planets in far off galaxies. moreover, it said to help humankind to find the first galaxy that formed and the stars planetary system. in simpler words how our galaxy was formed and if other planets could support life. which make it important for our culture to keep expanding and knowing more about our surroundings. how it works. light or electromagnetic wave which have wavelength, frequency, and speed. to see ancient galaxies the webb telescope built for mid infrared wavelengths. since light leaving the galaxy can take billions of years to reach earth when we look at . dark e it, we can see the accelerated expansion afterglow light past. the cosmos pattern dark ages development of . 400,000 yrs. j galaxies, planets, etc. continues to expand when light from faraway objects travels to earth, as it has since the big bang. as the universe 1st stars expands, the about 400 million yrs. waves that make rete ryoho . 13.7 billi up light get ion years stretched. th is figure 1an illustrated timeline of the universe . means that for light from distant galaxies, the visible light waves you can see with your eyes are stretched out so far that the longer wavelengths shift from visible light to infrared. this effect is known as redshift, and the further away an object is, the more redshift it experiences. it works in two different method, first method is called transit method in which the telescope will analyse the pattern of dimming that happens which tells scientist a lot, second method is direct imagining a coronagraph is built into the webb telescope. a coronagraph, like how you may use your hand to block a bright light, prevents starlight from reaching telescope sensors, allowing a dark exoplanet orbiting a star to be viewed. [1] the way we developed and improved till we captured the amazing footage of the galaxy (pic 2), it all started with sending a satellite to the space for communication purposes which how making a phone call works. then to capturing every corner of our planet earth to give us some understanding for our existence and geography in it. till we reached this day to analyse different planets and stars in our galaxy and more to come. the cons from sending all this stuff to space is the space junk we leave behind of the stuff that failed to work in that environment, it goes under space junk and its downside that it just rooming in space endlessly and it might hit another satellite that is properly functioning that may cause an unexpected failure for the project which takes a lot of time and budget to construct. [2] so, it always been an important interface for technology and culture wise, that made us reach this level of development for a better future. to this day we have not discovered a different life or another liveable planet. but personally, with our technology development and studies we might see the day where we capture and announce something we all dreamt about. ve 7 ""�� ~ , pic2. sparkler galaxy . conclusion. in conclusion, the james webb telescope is one of the biggest human machines to go to space with a stunning results like shown in the picture below. the evolution of sending satellitia to a telescope that can capture planets and stars in our universe is enough to show that our technological development is going for the better and hopefully to better results. . figure 2 space captured by webb telescope . refernce.

26,72,1272,"mass transit for high density living and their limitation due to pandemics. . abstract in cities with high population density, public transportation is a must for travel. it connects the work, sports, learning and entertainment sectors between different regions. public transport guarantees diversity within the consistency of urban planning and gives people a sense of belonging to the city. the second is the affordable and diversified service facilities for most residents. the most important thing is to ease the sense of congestion in cities by prioritizing green transportation. to protect the environment to the greatest extent possible. because of the universal and regional characteristics of public transportation, many restrictions are imposed in the face of epidemics. to prevent the explosive spread of disease among people, it is sometimes necessary to suspend many transportation routes. the suspension of traffic lines has caused many people to have problems traveling, and various problems have emerged in society. in severe cases, it will lead to chaos in the city. in view of the raging spread of the covid 19 in recent years, this article makes some summaries from the first perspective of living in high density cities, especially how to adapt to the uncertain factors of epidemic transmission. . introduction the high concentration of urban people and logistics makes it possible to develop a large capacity public transportation system. the bus led transportation mode facilitates the organization of scattered traffic behaviors into more efficient group traffic behaviors, efficiently utilizes urban space resources, and reduces per capita resource consumption. and pollutant emissions. this is also an important performance that high density cities are better than low density cities. transit led urban development emphasizes the combination of transportation mode and land use and strengthens the integration between urban systems. it is a higher mode of urban spatial resource planning and has higher efficiency. mass rail transit can also support high intensity comprehensive urban development with rail stations as the core, gathering population and economic activities. common practices include arranging public activity and service centers in urban groups in combination with rail transit stations and arranging ""park and ride"" facilities and bus interchange hubs near rail stations. the covid 19 pandemic has significantly changed urban life. crowds moving freely have dropped to unprecedented low levels. working from home is the new normal and for those who can afford it, it s even the beginning of an alternative way of working. the fate of millions of small businesses and employees makes working in urban centers uncertain. urban areas are estimated to account for 90 percent of all reported covid 19 cases. urban areas have become the epicenter of the outbreak.[1] urban areas are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus because of their population size and their high levels of global and local connectivity. on the other hand, there is no evidence that density itself correlates with higher virus transmission rates. cities can respond to this crisis and become hubs of energy, resilience and innovation that have made them such dynamic and engaging places to live for many. but as this policy brief will show, this will require conscious policy choices, particularly in addressing inequalities, building local capacity, and enabling green, inclusive recovery. for many cities recently, the covid 19 health crisis has expanded into a crisis involving urban access, urban equity, urban finance and safety, unemployment, public services, infrastructure, and transportation, all of which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups in society. . body the coronavirus (covid 19) has had a profound and significant impact on our world. right now, many of us are feeling overwhelmed by the flood of news, data, and the immediate impact on the lives and livelihoods of people around the world about covid 19. but while the situation is still evolving, there has been plenty of talk about what scenarios might emerge after the pandemic. we can t change the events that have happened, what we need to do is how to adapt. in my opinion, there are three major goals. universal access, efficiency, and green mobility. universal access in the early days of the disease, public transport systems around the world had plummeted in ridership and revenue and were forced to cut services. this is an even more worrying trend considering that before the pandemic, only about half of the world s urban population had easy access to public transport. the trend of declining passenger numbers due to covid 19, if not stopped and reversed, could jeopardize the transition to safe and sustainable transportation for all and hinder efforts to combat climate change and air pollution. this short term chaos is unavoidable, leaving many of our actions online.[2] in the long run, this could be a revolution. while there is no way to move all social activities online, this has also accelerated the adoption of online tools.[3] this increases the possibility of virtual connectivity, which is undoubtedly a development trend in the future. efficiency the covid 19 crisis has greatly disrupted the reliability and efficiency of transportation networks, especially in the aviation sector. the world has been forced to become closed, and many channels of communication are lacking. everyone s work process has become slow. take international students as an example, we must take online classes at home, although the online class system is already very perfect. online learning is not as efficient as face to face classrooms. up to now, governments and schools have introduced many policies. many international routes have been restored to ensure that international students can attend classes at the school, which greatly improves the efficiency of students enthusiasm for learning. green mobility the most unexpected impact of the crisis is on the environment, where pollution in new york city is decrease nearly 50% from a year earlier.[4] due to the shutdown of public transportation and the reduction in road traffic due to the pandemic prevention and control measures. this situation illustrates the impact of transportation on the planet and reminds us that reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation industry is technically possible. even though widespread shutdown is neither desirable nor realistic over the long term, the crisis could provide more viable opportunities to transition toward green mobility. . the increased shift to telecommuting and e commerce, for instance, could durably change our habits and lead to an overall reduction in transport demand, with a direct impact on emissions. . conclusion the current pandemic is accelerating trends such as digitization, the transition to remote work, and the virtual delivery of essential services. this transition to digital living creates an uncertain future for urban infrastructure and buildings, as demand for office space and housing is likely to decline subsequently. urban segregation and immigration could also accelerate as those with higher incomes seek new ways to live and work outside cities in response to the pandemic. if associated with urban sprawl and rising inequalities in terms of income, race and gender, migration away from cities could hamper important efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals, protect biodiversity and address the climate crisis. there is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the current reality of covid 19 and potential future pandemics, and to enable better recovery by building more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable cities. . reference list [1] un habitat, "" �opinion. covid 19 demonstrates urgent need

university australia . contents contents 1 abstract 2 introduction 3 body 4 conclusion ina | . 1 abstract 3 1 abstract there is no doubt in the fact that the most recent coronavirus pandemic has completely transformed lives and changed our vision for the future. the change can be seen and felt across many activities we do in our day to day life. for e.g., from grocery shopping, to working, commuting and other activities. before this pandemic came into existence there has been a push for higher density transportation systems throughout the world. with the increasing cost of living and the opportunity of remote work people are moving further away from the cities. these factors have added to the need for a better transportation system to increase connectivity between places. accordingly, the paper will discuss the changes brought in our lives due to covid 19. and the way the governments over the world are working towards improved transit systems contradicts itself. . 2 introduction 4 2 introduction ever since the coronavirus pandemic hit the world, people have become more and more cautious about the ways they commute specifically in mass transit systems. during the peak of coronavirus in 2020 and 2021, in many cities of the world people due to lockdown activities and work from home, there was a massive drop in the number of people using public transport. this was in total contradiction to what the governments and employers over the world were expecting. public transportation system is the number one means of transporta tion for the day to day life and is used to move high density of population from one place to another. however, because of the same reason it became a breeding ground for the coronavirus. with sars in 2003 and the recent coronavirus, it serves as a lesson to prepare for any upcoming pandemic in the possible fu ture. researchers all over the world are trying to understand the impact of mass transit systems during pandemics where luo et all{1| for once tried to find the optimal ratio between people traveling on mass transit systems and the disease spreading to the minimum. similar work is done by yang et al{2| wherein they aim to see what major factors affects the spread of the disease and what the operators can do to reduce the spread. in this paper we will be taking the coronavirus as a reference to the pandemics and evaluate the importance and significance of mass transit systems as whole both for the economy and the masses using it. . 3 body 5 3 body the coronavirus pandemic started having its full impact on the mass populations in the first quarter of 2020. this was the time when cities across the globe went into lockdown and people were forced to stay at home. flights were getting cancelled, work from home was starting to kick in strong, mass transport saw a huge decline in the number of patrons they saw every day. as the days passed, it made people rethink about the life choices and also forced the employers to adopt a remote working scenario. however, offices were not the only institution and schools and universities were also forced to switch to online classes. luo et all{1| tried to understand the impact of the pandemic on the public transport system. they describe using public transport as a double edged sword wherein on one hand it is performing a major role in getting essential workers to the place of work. it is also saving the environment by reducing emissions. while, on the other hand it can become a major carrier of the disease. they model the population of the city with the number of people using the mass transit system and try to understand how the disease propagates in different situations to come up with an optimal value. similar work was done by yang et all{2] where they engage to find which factors are the most dominant when it comes to the propagation of the virus in a pandemic on public transit systems. they also worked to find what measures can the operators take to minimize this spread along with keeping the service up and running. with all of this happening, there were already major transportation projects taking shape across the globe. it was done to reduce travel time between cities and suburbs considering how the increasing living cost in the cities. a one big and close example would be the sydney metro|3] which is australia's ambitious transportation project since date with the sole purpose of increasing the capacity and making mass transportation more accessible to everyone. companies all over the world are also, setting up world class offices to encourage people back in the offices. a few such examples would be atlassian|4| and amp{5] which started development of their new offices before the pandemic in these hopes. with all these developments in progress, the pandemic kicked in and soon work from home was a mandate in almost every country. nevertheless, with the roll out of the vaccines things slowly started going back to normal. companies and governments saw this moment as an opportunity and en couraged people to move and spend as much as they could to stimulate the economy. companies gave perks to employees by coming to the office, started covering transportation costs and providing food. governments for instance like the new south wales government gave vouchers to residents|6] to encour age them to travel, go out and spend some money basically. this again started to push the limits for mass transportation systems. now in the post pandemic state, people started to come out of their places, they started travelling and everything is coming back to normal. now the pop ulation has accepted the fact it is the new normal. it is at this state that mass transit again becomes vital because first it is the cheaper alternative for everyone, second it is a great way to reduce environmental emissions making . 3 body 6 it sustainable for the environment. this shows us that public transport is ex tremely important in the post pandemic eras also in the long run extremely sustainable for the environment and the population both. . 4 conclusion "" �i 4 conclusion as we can see that mass transit no matter what the situation is, plays a vital role for the economy and its people. they help the community around them flourish further by increasing connectivity, and also making their area a better place to live in. furthermore, pandemics never last forever and with enough measures the impact could be brought down. hence, we will always face a state when mass transit is required, and with the increasing population in almost every part of the world, its demand is only going to increase. mass transit provides a cheap, environmentally friendly and good connectivity to its users. hence, it is important for governments to strive for a better means and increase the comfort of its passengers. . references 8 references [1] q. luo, m. gee, b. piccoli, d. work, and 8. samaranayake,

3,0,1368,"mass transit for high density living and their limitation due to pandemics. liam howlin september 2022 1 abstract high density living is an unavoidable effect of growing populations and rising housing costs. with this increase in high density living, an appropriate level of mass transit is necessary because common means of transport in lower density housing areas, such as automobiles are too space inefficient, emit too much emissions and too much noise to be suitable for higher density living. to address this, high density living areas often have access to railways, bus routes and shops and workplaces are often within walking distance. these modes of transport more efficiently address the issue of high density living but their short comings were displayed during the global covid 19 pandemic. wherein the space efficient nature of buses and railways were a negative due to the increased transmission of covid 19. 2 introduction reliance on mass transit is inevitable, therefore we must mitigate the trans mission of viral diseases through various means. today, the majority of australians use a private motor vehicle for their daily work commute and other travel needs. with, ""66% of people [travelling] to work in a private car""� and 21% using public transport, cycling or walking. [1] this high prevalence of private motor vehicles has increased dramatically since the 1950s with the advent of increasingly cheaper production motor vehicles, and mass immigration to australia, increasing urban sprawl and putting strain on public transport system. . in the future, this is again expected to change, with higher density hous ing becoming more prevalent, and the ever increasing costs of private motor vehicle ownership. this future increase in public transport could be inter preted as an unnecessary risk in the wake of the global covid 19 pandemic, but as i prove in this paper, it is the only way to address mass transit in cities with high density living, and we can effectively mitigate against transmission through various means. 3 discussion 3.1 why we need public transport with the ever increasing prevalence of high density housing public transport must be available to solve the problem of mass transit. there are many benefits for public transport over private motor vehicles. including the fact that public transportation such as rail and buses emit much less emissions, per passenger per kilometer than private motor vehicles. [8] it is also more space efficient, meaning that there are more space for other activities. examples of streets that have been revitalised through the removal of cars, include george st in sydney's cbd which has seen a huge increase in foot traffic, due to the increased space and reduced noise. [5] public transport is cheaper for users and for the government, usually be cause the cost is subsidised by the government, citation needed. furthermore, once the initial investment has been spent, constructing railways and other infrastructure necessary for a public transport system, the maintenance costs are much lower than compared to the maintenance costs of public roads. [10] this expenditure on road maintenance is expected to increase due to wors ening extreme weather conditions, such as floods and extreme heat, which will make increase environmental damages to roads and other infrastructure and increase wear and tear. [9] in addition to these financial and environmental incentives to an expan sive public transport network there are other less concrete aspects supporting public transport. public transport affords lower income individuals freedom of movement compared to car dependant infrastructure which can render lo cations inaccessible or dangerous to pedestrians. this increase freedom of movement in turn supports a happier population and greater social mobility. 5) . public transport is also safer for society than private automobiles, due to a variety of factors. firstly, private motor vehicles cause many traumatic deaths and injuries each year during car accidents. trains and buses are much safer in comparison, as trains are on tracks they are unlikely to collide with other objects and the odds of derailment are very low. {4] buses are similarly safer than cars despite the fact they share the road with other private vehicles, their large size and weight means minimal risk of injury to occupants in the event of a collision. [6] furthermore, an increase in public transport use and availability will have an associated reduction in emissions and an improvement in air quality which will improve health for the general population. a recent publication the lancet medical journal attributes 9 million deaths to pollution each year. {3} there are also worse health outcomes for those who spend a lot of time driving each day, with each additional hour spent in a car per day is associated with 6% increase in likelihood of obesity. [2] 3.2 shortcomings of public transport during pandemics some short comings of mass transport were demonstrated during the covid 19 pandemic which increased the rate of transmission. public transport solu tions like trains and buses usually pack people into many people into a tight space where in the air is recirculated. these factors lead to the increased rate of transmission of viral diseases, including covid 19. to combat this increased rate of transmission nsw transport authority introduced several measures. these measures include mandatory mask wear ing, lower total capacity and frequent sanitising of common areas. [7] despite the government's efforts there will still be passengers which refuse to wear masks and social distance nullifying some efforts. to further combat the transmission of covid 19 many governments around the world introduced lock downs, orders which barred non essential travel and encouraged people to work from home. these orders further re duce the number of occupants on public transport as many commuters can work from home. {11} the decision to work from home has not been popular with businesses that rent expensive office space in cities, and they have encouraged their employees to return to the office. this could have been used as an opportunity to reduce reliance on office space which are seemingly obsolete for many industries. the reduced need for office space could result in this space be re appropriated for . residential purposes, lowering costs in city centres, reducing urban sprawl and allowing people who do not have the ability to work from home to live closer to their place of work. 4 conlusion in conclusion mass transport and its short comings are an unavoidable effect of high density housing. without a comprehensive public transport scheme the number of private motor vehicles on the round would cause much greater levels of traffic congestion, noise and air pollution. this in turn will increase the rate of climate change, and worsen physical and mental health outcomes for the population. despite this increasing our vulnerability to viral diseases, with well maintained hygiene and stay at home practices we can mitigate the transmission. references (1) david c cosgrove. long term patterns of australian public transport use. 2011.

17,57,750,"introduction. this paper discusses the implications and interdependency of social and technological innovations and how it will affect the way society interacts with each other in the workforce. sociotechnical by definition is the combination between social and technical components that will ultimately lead to the advancement of societies engagement with technology. during pandemics, workforces were forced to find a solution that would allow employees to continue to work without being confined in a small area. due to the covid 19 pandemic, workforces were able to find a systematic response that would change the way how companies would interact with each other. effects on workplaces. society before the covid pandemic have been able to connect with each other through the use of smartphones, email and social media but due to delayed response times, was not as effective as having a face to face interaction. with the improvement of telecom technologies, workforces found that the overall satisfaction of employees have improved due to better work life balance, less time taken to commute to and from the workplace which would lead to improved productivity. whilst the improvement of telecommunication has been able to decentralize workforces, worker efficiency may be reduced due to less in person interaction which affects the knowledge and information between the workplace. whilst the improvement of telecom communication continues, workplaces should not rely excessively on telecom technology as the negative effects on employees would greatly increase as the intensity of telework increases. work places that have been completely decentralized during the pandemic may have to deal with implications that comes with a heavy reliance on technology. how improvement of telecommunications affect the future of the company. with workplaces becoming decentralized due to the pandemic, companies will have a greater selection of potential employees due to previous long travel journeys that participants will face when applying for a job outside of their location. work places are able to utilize technology to keep employees engaged in the work by incorporating virtual reality, pre recorded videos and online meeting where employees will have a sense of involvement in the company while not being at the work place in person. with the improvement of telecommunications, information between the workforce can be spread instantly to a mass group of people and since many projects have a limited . amount of time to complete each task, the time saved can be focused on other areas of the project that require more attention. workplaces have realized that since tasks can be completed more efficiently when employees are working from home, they are able to cut costs on office spaces, supplies and building management. implementation of telework practices during the pandemic. due to the pandemic, workplaces were forced to adapt to the rules set out by the government in order to keep society safe while maintaining sustainability to keep their business afloat. as telework practices have greatly improved during the pandemic, companies have found that for a successful transition from an in person workforce to working from home, both the employees and employer must have a shared responsibility to sustain the business. due to uncertainty to whether there will be more waves of lockdown due to the pandemic, the transition to a complete in person workplace does not seem to provide any benefits than the current practices taking place. since a high percentage of employees are willing to telework in the future after post pandemic and employers realizing the work done can be completed at home, companies will most likely continue to adapt to the use of technology. conclusion. in conclusion, the improvement of telecom technology during the pandemic has greatly affected the work culture since companies have realized that work can be done more efficiently and productively than if employees were attending the work place in person. studies have shown that by relying too heavily on technology will have a negative impact on society, the pandemic has shown that an intermediate amount of technology will have the most positive effect on productivity and efficiency. overall i believe that the pandemic has forced society to adapt to the use of technology and will continue to have a lasting impact that will further decentralize workforces post pandemic. . references.

11,30,2206,"telecommunications technology revolutionises businesses and working methods in response to the covid 19 pandemic abstract keywords. labour, pandemic, remote work, technology introduction the covid 19 pandemic is the on going epidemic of coronavirus illness caused by severe acute respi ratory syndrome this occurrence was described at wuhan, china, in december 2019, declared to be a world health crisis of international interest on 30 january 2020, and recognised as an epidemic by the world health organisation on 11 march 2020 [1]. this epidemic has led to serious global economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, spiritual, political and social events, and general shortages of supplies aggravated by fear buying. the coronavirus pandemic outbreak of 2020 has placed flexible work arrangements, remote work in particular, in the spotlight [1]. with stay at home orders being issued by many nations, and only essential businesses being allowed to maintain their physical locations open, ineligible employers were required to implement flexible work options on the fly. while the scientific community was fully committing on finding a vaccine and mass producing doses with the . help of pharmaceutical corporations, telecommunication technologies were being developed and adopted for mass use by businesses and institutions in order to maintain productivity during the pandemic [2]. after two years from the covid 19 outbreak, the widely adopted remote work solution left a permanent mark on how businesses and corporations operate, and reverting back to strictly onsite labour seems impossible for most cases. covid 19 and the rise of remote work for years, some organisations and corporations resisted allowing their employees to work remotely, thinking it was impractical for some characters to change to the remote framework [2]. yet, once the now infamous covid 19 spread, everyone had the huge wake up call to what is possible. in a brief time span, thousands of workers transitioned from onsite employees to full time remote workers. today, doubts not just of remote versus in office work are being grown, but likewise of part time versus full time employees. after all, some businesses that seemed to require in office workers do not, then maybe some of the older lines between part time and full time require reevaluating, too. this is particularly crucial for smaller businesses that seek to attract and retain talent [2]. the extensive adoption of remote work under covid 19 constituted a major organizational trans formation [3]. however, the implementation of remote work during covid 19 was hurried, and new technologies and operating systems have had to be implemented without previous testing or training. organisations reported concerns about losses in culture and productivity whilst workers were more concerned about the decline in social interactions, internet connectivity and increased workload [3]. the remote work arrangement during covid 19 was better for higher paid and higher management personnel in terms of productivity and reported well being, whereas individuals at the bottom end of the eating spectrum experienced reduced remuneration. remote work arrangements during covid 19 also had an impact on employee financial stability and reduced social connection. the evolution of business infrastructures and processes through digitalisation as the majority of companies and organizations were facing the need to support and manage remote workers, many between employers and employees had to quickly familiarise themselves with digital tools to maintain productivity [4]. project management software, communication apps, video conferencing tools, electronic mail, and shared documents are just a few of the many solutions at their disposal, all essential elements for assisting a remote workforce stay connected. during the pandemic, the adoption of tools like zoom, slack, jira and google drive steeply increased, and since then, companies embraced the change and modified their processes accordingly [4]. security also became a major factor, as the digitalisation process transferred a lot of important data 2 6 . from its physical form to a digital storage [5]. many corporations had already been using remote access infrastructures, however, the capacity they had to support was a lot higher than their initial designs would have expected, as most of these solutions were not built to operate with most of the workforce online simultaneously, which was the source of many potential security risks [5]. the software sectors of these firms had to upgrade or replace the systems in use in order to tackle this capacity issue, and because of the time constraints they had to deal with, there was little time to operate security checks and ensure that no vulnerabilities would arise in these new remote access protocols and infrastructures [5]. cloud services were also increasingly implemented and adopted to rapidly face these capacity needs [5]. the usage of cloud solutions suffered similar security risks because of the time and resource constraints, risks that could have been dealt with after more thorough and time consuming assessments. such risks were also present when company chose to adopt existing solutions offered by cloud service providers that were generally considered solid and secure infrastructures, mainly because these services would have still required the corporations themselves to work on the security of their environments [5]. the last vulnerability this major change procured was the employees unfamiliarity with remote work and online tools, that mixed with the high levels of stress caused by the pandemic, would make them easy victims of social engineering and phishing attacks from malicious parties [5]. remote work from an employee's perspective before the pandemic, remote work was stigmatised and employees working from home often had a bad reputation. distractions from the domestic environment and the inability for managers to control the workforce were two important factors that drove this stigma. only employees with specific needs that needed special arrangements were granted this privilege, and even these cases were extremely rare [2]. however, with the advancements of the telecommunications technology and the development of solid teleconferencing solutions, this stigma is slowly fading away, and more and more businesses are adopting a hybrid approach to work. it is not uncommon for companies to offer employees the chance to work remotely once or twice a week [6]. this process started two years after the initial covid 19 outbreak, when workers around the world started getting used to this new work arrangement, with some ending up preferring it to the traditional in office alternative [3]. data from u.s. surveys shows that many benefits come with remote work. employees working remotely work 1.4 days per month more than onsite employees, which amounts to 17 more days days per year [3]. â¢ employees working remotely take breaks that are 4 minutes longer on average than onsite employ ees, but they also work 10 minutes more per day [3]. 3 6 . 16% 4% remote postings remote searches (share of au job postings) (share of au job searches) 12 3 8 2 4 1 o ""��""�� eee"" 0 jan aug mar oct may apr

while onsite employees are unproductive for 37 minutes. this statistic does not include lunch or breaks [3]. â¢ distractions from managers and bosses are perceived in less amounts for employees working remotely, amounting to 15% of the survey subjects, while 22% of onsite employees said that they were distracted by their managers and bosses [3]. even though remote work seems to have many benefits for employees and employers, if not imple mented correctly, workers could experience higher levels of stress, and mental health problems. work life balance is also a risk, as employees that work remotely will struggle separating work hours to the other daily activities, especially with a lack of policies and processes that assist the workforce [3]. work from home option as a job requirement for australian office workers research shows that 35% of australian office employees would quit their job and start looking for alternatives if their workplace would require them to come back to full time in office work. this data is a real indicator for how drastic the change in worker needs and expectations is change over the past few years, and how this new remote access infrastructures are well accepted and sought after by companies and workers [6]. flexibility has become an important element in the factors that lead a worker to apply for a job, and this seems to be of even more relevance for australia, as research shows that australian workers work remotely an average of 2 days a week, significantly higher than the average of 27 countries around the world, 1.5 days a week [6]. while australian employers would prefer if workers had just one day of remote work, their employees would rather work from home at least two days a week. after the pandemic, the number of job searches that specifically included the option of remote work increased rapidly, as shown in figure 1. by following this trend, if businesses do not embrace this evolution, they might struggle to retain and attract professionals in the years to come. 4 6 . potential share of time spent working @ effective potential (no productivity loss) ml theoretical maximum remotely by sector in

not halted the establishment of remote work as an option for office workers, setting in motion a necessary structural shift in management and flexibility for employees. in the previous section data seems to prescribe a future in which remote work will persist, and hybrid work will become normality for office jobs. figure 2 shows an estimate of the sectors for which remote work will most likely persist and further develop, based on the type of activities required, and how many of them can be efficiently done remotely [7]. many technology and telecommunications companies are exploring new solutions for remote work. not only ways to improve communication and interaction, but also services that could augment the range of work that could be done remotely [8]. virtual reality seems to be the next technology that will be slowly inserted in businesses, with meta, htc, and samsung being the forerunners of this new step forward [8]. conclusion after 2 years from the covid 19 outbreak, and towards the end of the pandemic, it is fair to say that for many workers around the world infrastructures and processes have changed drastically, and these changes 5 6 . seem to be more permanent than anyone could have expected [7]. many businesses nowadays have the capacity to allow office employees to work remotely, thanks to the adoption of technologies that prior to the pandemic were scarcely used, if not for specific it related sectors. hybrid work is now becoming normality, and especially in australia, employees prefer it to the in office alternative [6]. from an employer's perspective, there is research showing that there are productivity and efficiency advantages to remote work, but there are also many risks related to the workforce's mental health and increase in stress if not structured with they well being in mind. it is clear that remote work is not going to disappear anytime soon, and that it is going to evolve and persist in many sectors, to allow more flexibility to more employees, and grant more opportunities to people and businesses that want to keep up with technology advancements. references (11 t, galanti, g. guidetti, e. mazzei, s. zappala, and f. toscano,

20,53,1159,"the effect of automation on the economy, workers and future jobs abstract the purpose of this paper is to give an opinion and to review the effect that automation has on talents and their future job prospects. automation is the use or introduction of automatic equipment in a manufacturing or other process or facility. according to the organisation for economic co operation and development (oecd), as of 2021, approximately 36% of current jobs in australia are at risk of being automated where 11% are at a high risk probability of being automated while the remaining 25% have the probability of seeing large changes to the relevant jobs [2]. the risk that automation potentially has to workers today and into the future can go down two routes which will be explored within this paper. introduction from my perspective, there is no single path that we can certainly know to go down that may help or harm workers and the future job market because automation is here and is not going anywhere so what would be the best outcome, it can go either way, historically when similar situations have occurred those that lost jobs due to the implementation of automation, workers have found new jobs within these industries [1] or outside of them. the next question would be if this phenomenon will continuously occur, much like it did historically, today where automation is exponentially occurring more today and in the future with the rise and expansion of information technology (it), artificial intelligence (ai), and technology in general. . over the last century, there has been an ever increasing number of industries that have taken on board automation over their human, muscle power, counterparts causing people to lose their jobs as a result. this issue has been upfront in the transition to automated methods and the fight to keep people s jobs from as early as the 1800s. however, of course, those that are losing their jobs due to the switch to automated methods, saw this to be a negative outcome in the moment but could actually prove to be a positive outcome in the long run. the issue of losing jobs due to automation has been a documented issue and a source of anxiety from as early as the 1800s with a group called the luddites. this group consisted of workers in the textile industry that lost their jobs to automated machinery replacing them for the purpose of labour saving and wage saving by the factory owners that employed them [1]. in response to this change, the luddites caused mayhem, terrorised, and destroyed the machinery due to the factory owners refusing to appease the worker s demands to keep their jobs and subsequently their livelihoods. economic growth according to mckinsey & company, automation is an opportunity for australia not only for the government but also for australians, they state that if australia were to transition to automation it could reap large benefits such as an addition of $1.2 trillion to the economy by 2030 and also give each australian additional income of $30,000 over that period [4]. they also state that a "" �bold push to rapidly automate""� could see triple the benefits previously stated rise to $4 trillion and $110,000 respectively [4]. hence, automation in a sense has an enticing offer for the government and australians, however, this may not outweigh the potential negatives when it . comes to the number of jobs that could be displaced and the effects that this could have on australians. job displacement vs job creation the discussion of automation in the media and other sources seems to centre around the battle between the number of jobs potentially displaced and the jobs created if automation were to be implemented. according to cisco's projection models, it suggests that 630,000 workers could be displaced by technology by 2028 [3] which they state could produce the same amount of economic output, during 2019, with approximately 7% fewer workers [3]. this wave of displacement would heavily impact sectors such as business and professional services, construction, government and community services, and many more. however, compared to other countries such as vietnam, indonesia, the usa, etc. australia has lower numbers for displacement in comparison. on the other side of the coin, it is often stated that onboarding automation and technology in general would add jobs to the market. this ultimately depends on the sector that is in question, according to cisco's projections, in various sectors of the australian economy there is a net negative of jobs lost to jobs gained, except for three sectors retail trade, healthcare, and social assistance, and educational services [3]. although cisco estimates that upwards of a million jobs could be created by 2030. either way, it is hard to predict exactly what would happen if this would occur it is definite that jobs will be lost but it is also definite that jobs will be created it ultimately comes to how many losses and gains will occur and how many workers who are displaced are able to transition to another job or to transition their skills to match what is currently required within the job market in light of these changes. . job market with automation and advances in technology being an ever present occurrence today and in the foreseeable future many jobs will be displaced, lost, or become obsolete. to â€˜pushback against this change or to try and survive this inevitable outcome workers need to learn new skills that either save their position or help them evolve to a new job. both cisco and mckinsey & company support that the current workforce does not have the skills that are necessary to not only transition to a more automated world but also in a general sense for the future economy [3, 4]. conclusion in conclusion, there is no clear answer to the effect that automation may have on workers and their future job prospects it could go many different directions however looking historically there will be some bumps in the road for many who will most likely lose their jobs or be displaced but people will adapt and evolve through either finding a new job somewhere or learning new skills that allow them to easily transition into some new role. from an economical standpoint, automation will, in a sense, give a boost to the economy, automation will have a warm welcome down the red carpet with an ovation in the eyes of the government as it will give a hefty contribution to the economy over the following years through to 2030 and beyond. . reference l. j.

6,5,1415,"the effect of sydney's metro on city wide culture and societal connections christopher powell sid. the sydney metro project is currently in construction of its second section, which aims to connect the north west suburbs to the city. this will be achieved with high end modern technology, including high voltage power electronics and power control systems. this paper aims to identify how the completion of the entire sydney metro project will contribute to sydney's cultural identity, through research and experience. the key findings that will be detailed in this paper are culture is spread and shared predominantly through travel, and the metro will contribute to this with well thought out locations in a modern approach. the definition of cultural diffusion, according to dc library, is "" �cultural diffusion is the spreading out and merging of pieces from different cultures.""� [1]. the transport networks of sydney are one of the most integral factors of its identity of many cultures, and sydney metro contributes to this with a modern and robust take on public transport. the spreading and reinforcing of cultural features and traits has always been highly dependent on not just how quickly these new concepts could be shared, but also on the frequency at which they were appearing, reinforcing them and creating a sense of interconnectedness between cultural groups. the sydney metro north west line, opened in may 2019, and the upcoming extension from chatswood to sydenham are examples of how public transport networks keep sydney culturally connected, doing so with modern technology. . sydney is a diverse city with cultures present from all around the world, which have had the chance to share and integrate throughout all of sydney due to the interconnectedness presented by the public transport networks. the concept of cultural diffusion can be demonstrated in the silk road. while there were not actual defined roads that connected europe and asia, the concept of the silk road details how culture can be spread through trade and travel. the article â€˜the silk road. connecting people and cultures by the smithsonian [2] states "" �while largely commercial, the silk road provided the vehicle for all sorts of creative exchange between tremendously diverse peoples and cultures.""� the article goes on to detail how silks that originated in china were later found throughout europe as a result of these trade routes, as well as many other goods and foods from these linked cultures. a similar parallel of sharing cultures can be applied to sydney's public transport systems. the north west metro links together major suburbs of northern sydney, allowing for ease of access to the present cultures in these suburbs. for example, the shopping district of chatswood has a very different feel to rouse hill town centre. previously, commutes between the two would be upwards of an hour and a half with up to three changes, totalling four different bus routes utilised to make the journey. presently, the commute between the two is just over 30 minutes on the metro line. another major cultural location that has been made easily accessible by the metro is macquarie university. universities are great contributors to a society s culture, as they promote interactions between people from all different backgrounds and upbringings. an article by piotr luczak [3] states "" �universities are well placed to lead the way in supporting and celebrating the cross cultural exchange""�. this is due to their accommodation of intercultural learning and interactions, which we can attribute to their fostering of international students and people of all cultures. the implementation of a metro station near macquarie university allows easier access for students who live further away. with an expansion of the metro to sydney's north and centre currently under construction [4], and a further expansion to the south west in its planning and design phase [5], these previously mentioned areas are being linked with other areas of cultural importance, most significantly being the city centre. metro stations are being constructed at barangaroo, pitt st, and central, which allows easy access to all parts of the city centre. these stations, along with the crows nest and victoria cross stations located in north sydney, and waterloo, located just south of the city . centre, will become an integral part of people's commutes whether it be for work, entertainment, travel, or nightlife. due to these factors, both the existing and future sections of sydney's metro system accommodate the cultural diffusion between the micro communities that are found across sydney. sydney metro is a modern and robust piece of infrastructure that will eventually connect the city with its north west and south west regions, through fast and efficient means. sydney is heralded as the worst planned city in australia, due to poor planning rooting back to the first fleet, and its rail system is no exception. as stated in the sydenham to bankstown metro information page [5], "" �trains from 15 lines from all across sydney compete for just six tracks, creating a bottleneck.""�. to make matters worse this bottleneck occurs in the centre of sydney, at town hall station. this creates huge rail congestion at peak times, as a balance between rail congestion and passenger throughput is attempted. this is one of the issues aimed to be solved with the completion of the sydney metro project. the metro has been designed to be robust, and with the success of the north west lines from tallawong to chatswood, it has proven how efficient rail based public transport can be. there are many benefits the metro has over the existing train lines, most of which are a result of the underground tracks that are unique to the metro line. since the train lines run in two parallel tunnels, there are less chances of delays being caused by rain damage or wet weather conditions, and there is little to no noise pollution to affect nearby residential areas. other benefits include the consistent frequency of trains, with one arriving every 4 minutes, no need to merge onto other rail lines, and driverless trains which result in less human error. the design is very modern, with state of the art switchgear and power control systems for the 33kv and 11kv systems needed to run the trains, as well as high voltage transformers and rectifier transformers that provide consistent power to the overhead power lines. each station has well over 20km of cabling running inside between all the power electronics, whether it be fibre optic cables to transmit data, 125v dc cabling for cabinet power, 11kv and 33kv power cabling, or 3.8 6.6kv traction cabling that will power the trains. there is a lot of foresight into reliability in this, with multiple cables being run with the same job, but through different paths. . this would prevent the systems from shutting down in case of emergency, such as one of the cables catching fire for example. the design of the sydney metro has not just been focused on creating something that works, but also something that pushes the bounds of what's possible. the victoria cross cavern (underground area dug out for the platform and power controls rooms) is the largest in australia at 265m long, 25m wide, and 20m high [6]. the rouse hill bridge, a 270m long curved cable stayed bridge over windsor road, was built to connect tallawong station and rouse hill station. it was named "" �enr's project of the year as well as [won] the global best project award for the railway sector.""� [7]. with the use of modern technology, the current and future sections of the sydney metro will provide a consistent and capable means of transport for residents and tourists for many years to come. the sharing of culture across the world through history has been achieved through the trading of goods and concepts, which has been driven by travel. sydney metro in its finished state will allow the diverse cultures of sydney to be shared and experienced more easily than ever, through its use of modern technologies. . references [1] "" �cultural diffusion""�, dclibrary.org https. https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/6MmQCr810kCjD1zPcxnMrQ?domain=dclibrary.org node 62675 (accessed sep. 30, 2022) [2] r.

2,52,1341,"the implementation of wireless communication technologies against covid 19 pandemics. abstract. due to the covid 19 pandemic, the whole world is facing a health and economic crisis. countries across the world are using digital technologies to fight this global crisis. the purpose of this paper is to examine how wireless communications help the world against the covid 19 pandemic from multiple perspectives and the inspiration from this pandemic for future generations. in this paper, we will show why wireless communication technologies are important against pandemics, and how these technologies help countries from around the world against the pandemics by tracking the spread of the virus, implementing online education and online working, and healthcare automation. next, we will discuss the challenges we face with wireless communication technologies, such as personal information security, privacy, and data corruption. 1. introduction. coronavirus disease (covid 19) is an infectious respiratory disease that has spread to almost all the countries in the world in a very short time. the coronavirus has caused shortages of foods and commodities, seriously affecting people s daily life. during this pandemic, most organizations and governments use digital technologies against this pandemic. to reduce close contact, most organizations start using wireless communication technologies like zoom, and skype. some countries have managed to deliver essential medical supplies to remote areas by using drones. to discover the hidden virus, most countries use thermal sensors to detect people who may have the signs like high body temperatures in public areas like bus stations, supermarkets, and airports. in this essay, | will talk about how wireless communication technologies are used in social distance monitoring and contact tracing, assisting medical personnel, and online education and working. in the last, | will talk about the challenges we are facing by highly depending on wireless communication technologies and possible solutions. . 2. implementation of wireless communication technologies against pandemics. the priority goal during the global pandemic is to prevent the spread of covid 19. in this section, we will discuss how the wireless communication and localization system takes advantage of healthcare, education and the economy. | will also introduce these techniques from different perspectives, and the challenges we are facing. 2.1. tracking the spread of the virus. according to the who, the most efficient way to limit the spreading of the virus is to prevent mass gatherings and keep social distance. | will discuss the technologies used to track both indoor and outdoor spreading of viruses. 2.1.1. indoor tracking. the purpose of indoor positioning is to maintain social distance in the indoor environment. it is challenging to get the indoor position because gps signals are unavailable. the technologies that can be used for indoor positioning are wifi, bluetooth, radio frequency identification (rfid), visible light, and zigbee [5]. a new tracking positioning technology was developed for workforce distance monitoring while maintaining essential business activities [8]. when workers are too close to each other, a small device attached to their hat will notify them and all the position data will be collected on a centralized server. when a worker has tested positive, we can use this system to find which person has close contact with him. 2.1.2. outdoor tracking. the virus can be tracked by using cellular positioning systems, global positioning systems (gps), and drones [7]. networks of drones can monitor crowds to maintain social distance as well as monitor body temperatures and possibilities of viruses, sneezing and coughing in the public area [3]. when drones detect critical data, they will report to authorities and take action immediately. one of the most efficient ways to prevent the spreading of the virus is contact tracing of infected patients. by using bluetooth signals, google and apple developed a contact tracing system to detect nearby smartphones and notify the users if they are close to possible . covid 19 patients, they also collect the location data. this kind of system is quite helpful for public health researchers to understand the virus spread by monitoring the data. 2.2. online education and working schools have been closed for months due to the control of the spreading of the virus need to practice social distancing. online education seems to be the only choice to help students continue their education. online learning requires a good internet connection and smart devices. however, not all teachers and students and high speed internet and powerful smart devices. to solve this problem, governments need to provide smart devices and internet access to the poverty stricken area [4]. 2.3. healthcare hospitals can use robots to reduce the burden on medical personnel, such as checking the patients temperatures, delivering drugs, and doing basic cleaning work. medical robots also can prevent medical personnel from exposure to the virus. these medical robots can collect patients information and send the data to the data analysis centre to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. an advanced wireless healthcare system was developed based on the implementation of 5g technologies [9]. in this system, the medical experts at a hospital can help patients from miles away remotely, such as diagnose the condition and propose a treatment plan. 2.4. challenges and possible solutions various implementations of wireless communication technologies provide a positive impact during the covid 10 pandemic. however, these technologies also bring challenges to privacy and security. in the following, we will discuss these problems and possible solutions. 2.4.1. privacy the technologies for tracking the virus need to access users location information and mobile phone data which invade people's privacy [6]. the collection of these data can be used by the organization and government for different kinds of purposes, such as surveillance and financial purposes. the first solution to these problems is for organizations and governments need . to notify users before collecting access to the data and users have the authority to deny the access. secondly, use bluetooth low energy (ble) because it is less invasive of privacy [2]. 2.4.2. security during the covid 19 pandemic, global internet traffic increased by 30% because most organizations and schools start working and educating online. the increase in internet usage will also create more malicious attacks, such as malware and phishing [1]. it is challenging for all organizations and schools to provide identification for all users which also gives hackers more opportunities to steal valuable information. organizations and schools need to prevent the attack by educating employees and students on how to against cyberattacks and raising their awareness. 3. conclusion. in this essay, | discussed the challenges that covid 19 brought to us, and how organizations use wireless communication technologies to solve these problems, such as tracking the spread of the virus, online education and working, and using medical robots for healthcare. then, | talk about the challenges we are facing using these technologies and the possible solutions. | think wireless communication technologies have an irreplaceable position for winning the pandemic. researchers are recommended to focus on protecting individuals privacy, and security, and connect remote areas for a better future. . reference list.

23,50,1225,"the improvement of telecom technology leads to the rise of connectivity during pandemics. . abstract the covid 19 pandemic has put many peoples lives at risk, mentally and physically, and economically for countries. however, technology has been used at an unprecedented way to improve the lives of businesses, schools and people overall. this study aims to seek out the major benefits that telecom and digital technologies had on various aspects of the society. i. introduction technology has had promising outcomes ever since it was being invented through out the industrial era and prior to that. coupled with the desire of humans to socialise and access to a wide range of knowledge over the years, humans were able to improve technology for communication and achieve unprecedented projects like putting the first man on the moon with a computer system weaker than any smartphone. over the decades, telecommunication has risen rapidly and steadily enough that in essence, almost it seems like all the technological advances have been building up for a situation exactly like the covid 19 pandemic. the pandemic caught countries and governments completely off guard, a sizable section of the employees was told to remain at home and continue working remotely while the lockdowns or stay at home measures went into effect. families were forced to live apart, restaurants were on the brink of shutting down and school children were in despair. however, governments and people were able to communicate purely thru the form of telecommunication technology. families were able to keep in touch virtually thru the form of video conferencing, restaurants were able to completely transform themselves into delivery based outlets through the use of online websites and social media and school children were able to resume their normal education via video conferencing on zoom. this study aims to shine a light on the rise of key telecom technology that was utilised in various industries affected by the pandemic thru review based research to methodically present the advances of each case study. ii. background healthcare aspect the pandemic affected almost every possible industry. however, the healthcare industry was affected the most and in a very unpredictable manner. in order to enhance the global public health response to covid 19, digital technologies are being used for population surveillance, case identification, case management, evaluation of treatments based on mobility data, and public outreach. the international health regulations (2005) mandate that all nations possess a core capability to guarantee domestic readiness for infectious dangers . that have the potential to spread internationally. during outbreaks, when innovation is necessary, research and development of new techniques and technologies to increase these fundamental capabilities frequently take place. [1] one such instance where technology was implemented successfully was when hong kong used electronic data systems to locate disease clusters during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. a similar approach was used during the ebola outbreak and now in the covid 19 pandemic where technology was used to understand the dynamics of the outbreak and implement preventative strategies worldwide. [1] targeted public health messaging web based epidemic intelligence tools syndromic surveillance mobility pattern analysis telemedicine contact tracing apps symptom reporting apps data dashboards chat bots 25en interactive geospatial maps fig 1. the interconnected digital technologies used in the public health response to covid 19. [1] as shown in fig 1, although several digital technologies were utilised, the study further provides insights on key useful methods. during the pandemic, data dashboards are widely utilised to compile real time public health data, such as confirmed cases, deaths, and testing figures, in order to inform the public and assist policymakers in improving actions. moreover, instead of relying on a laboratory diagnosis, syndromic surveillance networks rely on reports of clinical symptoms, such as ""influenza like illness,"" from hospitals and other designated sentinel primary and secondary healthcare facilities that agree to regularly give surveillance data on all cases. and finally, the improvement of technology in the telecommunications industry has greatly benefitted, by using symptom based case identification, for enabling wider access to community testing and self testing, automating and accelerating the reporting process to public health databases, and other techniques, digital technology can augment clinical and laboratory notification. . social aspect due to social conventions that encourage social isolation and widespread lockdowns, the covid 19 pandemic has inevitably resulted in a rise in the usage of digital devices. worldwide, individuals and organisations have had to adapt to new ways of living and working. most individuals are currently using the internet and internet based services to communicate, engage, and carry out their work duties from home as a result of the lockdown. utilization of internet services has increased from 40% to 100% as a percentage of pre lockdown levels. [2] businesses, households and schools relied on various digital transitions to achieve close to normal standards of living pre pandemic. most of the digital transformation technologies that are being used by mostly enterprises as part of their transformation endeavour are cloud, internet of things (lot), blockchain, artificial intelligence (ai), and machine learning (ml) technologies. out of these, blockchain technology was and is still highly regarded for secure and safeguard information transformation methods and is used by almost every industry. [2] this breakthrough in technology proved to be effective in a time when online fraud and security were also on the rise along with covid 19. the pandemic has produced an environment of unpredictability that encourages scammers to take advantage of the crisis by obtaining money or information or by creating vulnerabilities. [3] however, although it is likely that the rate of online unethical activities will only increase after the pandemic, telecom technology still proves to be worth the gamble with the introduction of new security measures. r 18 web based user â€˜ had al interface ii | patient fig 2. connectivity via cloud based software . moreover, as shown in fig 2, cloud based technology has been paramount in linking people of different age groups and backgrounds to sharing information and entertainment. one such platform is the rise of twitter and essentially the rise of microblogging. the ability for twitter users anywhere in the world to spread information and break news without relying on the press to initiate it has been a crucial tool that anyone with access to technology has. the ability for government officials to express their thoughts without reviewing it thru a biased media enterprise has allowed people to differentiate between rumours and facts, this proved essential during the covid 19 pandemic when factual information was crucial for people. ill. conclusion in conclusion, this study has pointed out a few aspects of where technological advances that have proven to benefit people during the pandemic. we can see that technology has indeed made a dent and continues to benefit humanity through its constant improvements. although the same preventive and isolation measures were in place for both the 1909 influenza pandemic and the covid 19 pandemic, covid 19 pandemic has not been able to outlast the influenza pandemic both economically and medically for countries mainly due to utilising telecommunication technology. references [1] b.s. m.e.m.m.v.l.m.z.m.e.g.r.v.c.e.m.m.s.n.k.m.j.s.d. ple. m.l j.c. d.h. a.m. j. jobie budd, "" �digital technologies in the public health response to covid 19,""� 2020.

0,21,1224,"abstract science and technology can improve human culture and quality of life, regulate the relationship between man and nature, increase productivity, promote economic development and facilitate social change. through science and technology, human beings have developed from primitive societies to today s advanced, well established societies. through the use of science and technology, productivity has improved, tools and energy sources have become more and more advanced, and human beings have observed nature and used resources wisely to improve science and technology. with the advancement of science and technology, the quality of human life has been promoted, and social economy and development have been affected. in addition, human needs and social changes have influenced the development of science and technology. 2. introduction since the modern renaissance, mankind has experienced three scientific and technological revolutions, each of which has made a huge leap in productivity and had a profound impact on the world s economic development and changes in production and lifestyles. now it is the 21st century, the era of information, science and technology spreads to every corner of life. along with the development of science and technology, people s lives have also been greatly changed. thousands of years ago, people s pursuit was to eat well and wear warm clothes, however, nowadays, the expectation for the quality of life is not only to eat well, but also to eat good food, eat food from all over the world. wearing brand name clothes, wearing good looking clothes. the development of science and technology has improved the quality of life, and at the same time, people s expectation for quality of life has promoted the further development of science and technology. in addition, the use of smart home improves the quality of life and provides convenience and high efficiency for daily life. 3. body the development of science and technology has contributed to the development of society, the improvement of productivity and the change of people s way of life. modern technology has changed the traditional production methods, reduced the cost of production, improved the quality of products, and greatly increased labor productivity. the quality of life is of great concern because it affects everyone. this is especially true for the elderly, the sick, and the poor [1]. because of the physical limitations of the elderly, some things that can be done by normal adults may be difficult or carry great risks for the elderly and people with illnesses. for this reason, more and more science and technology are being researched in this area, such as smart homes, video calls, environmental monitoring systems, tele health and human detection, and robotics. human detection and tele health are mainly designed to address security and safety needs with emergency call solutions and fall detectors. smart home and environmental detection systems are developed and evaluated with the aim of creating a possible way to improve the comfort and safety of older and younger people, promoting physical . independence while improving quality of life and reducing the burden on caregivers. food is a necessity that people need to live, and the production and improvement of food already has a mature science and technology system [2]. there are scientific and technological improvements in seed breeding, cultivation and collection methods, plant growth management, and transportation river processing. through special methods, high quality seeds are selected [3], and the criteria for judging the quality of seeds are based on market demand. for example, those that are cheaper, more productive, faster growing, and have high nutritional value. then, people plant intensively by large areas, and the intensive planting facilitates the use of large machines for plowing and harvesting [4]. in addition, there are various fertilizers and nutrient solutions to provide the right growing environment for plants. by adjusting different parameters, including sunlight duration, the concentration of nutrient solution components, and conducting controlled trials, the growth of plants can be effectively adjusted to improve the quality and yield of food through numerous experiments. however, as the world s population continues to increase and the demand for food grows, society needs more efficient and advanced science and technology to meet the demand for food, and such science and technology is supported by society to develop rapidly [2]. energy has become the cornerstone of human civilized society, and in the face of increasing energy demand, science and technology in new energy sources have been incorporated into the strategic plans of various countries [5]. from the early days of burning coal and minerals to generate electricity, to later clean energy generation such as hydroelectricity and solar power, and then to nuclear power technology, all of them have alleviated society s demand for energy. at the same time, society also strongly supports the research and development of new energy sources, and human society and science and technology have influenced each other and are inseparable. however, science and technology are not only positive effects, sometimes science and technology also bring negative effects, such as environmental pollution, large amounts of carbon emissions. with the massive use of fossil energy, a large amount of pollutants are released into the environment, and the large amount of carbon emissions deteriorate the earth s climate, destroy the ozone layer, melt the glaciers, and raise the sea level [6]. accidents similar to oil spills have also damaged large areas of the ecological environment and are difficult to clean up. in the face of such environmental! impacts, humans have enacted relevant policies, including carbon emission limitation policies. even with such negative impacts, science and technology cannot stop in the face of social needs, and they have to be optimized while developing, which is the interaction between science and technology and social change. 4. conclusion the development of science and technology promotes the progress of society and improves the quality of human life. at the same time, the development of science and technology needs the support of society, and with the support of society, science and technology develops by leaps and bounds. this is the interaction between science and technology and the quality of human life and . social development. 5. reference [1] c. siegel and t. e. dorner, "" � information technologies for active and assisted living ""�� influences to the quality of life of

13,15,2954,"abstract the purpose of this paper is to assess the interdependency of telecommunication technology and people's lifestyles during pandemics. the focus point of this paper is, how telecommunication technology and people's working, studying styles impact and motivate the changes, innovations, and improvements of each other. the paper will introduce how people's lifestyles changed after the outbreak of pandemics, and the improvements and innovations of the telecommunication technology with its implementation to people's life. this paper will also include the benefits and challenges of implementing telecom technology to people's daily life. 1. introduction after the first pandemic of covid 19 outbreak in wuhan, china[1], the pandemic soon went global as hundreds of countries announced with multiple confirmed cases. the world health organization declared the pandemic of covid 19 as a global public health emergency crisis in march, 2020.[2] governments of many countries announced policies to prevent further infection and filter groups or individuals that were infected (or unconfirmed possibly infected)[3]. the requirement for technologies that were capable of supporting people's daily life, e.g., working, studying, had sharply increased. these technologies supported people with their daily lives, assisted governments with control of covid 19, and maintained functioning of companies, public transport, public utilities, and the functionality of governments. this paper will discuss the interdependency of improvement of telecom technology and society during and after pandemics. the focus points as follow. the need of and trigger of improvement in telecom technology from the society, changes and improvement of the society with the development and innovation of telecom technology, the benefits and challenges of this interdependency. 1.1 brief introduction of counter covid measurements the counter covid measurements to introduce are majorly consisted of 2 parts. isolation and close contact warning. citizens were informed to perform self isolation[4] at home or the garden they were living in unless with necessary, e.g., shopping for food, mandatory in person attendance education or working. this measurement was capable of protecting citizens from getting infected and prevent the infected from further spreading the virus. australia announced international travel restriction[5] in january 2020 to prevent virus entering australia carried by individuals. citizens were required to have certain apps installed to their mobiles and register themselves with health and vaccination status. scan of qr codes and report their health status and arrivals were one of the necessary steps that needed to be taken before entering some public locations[6]. citizens were alerted with possible close contact if they were in the same area with those who were infected. 1.2 related works this study[7] presents the workplace adjustments and decentralise of workforces with the relation of telecommunication technologies. the work explained society's trend that started shifting to �work from home""� style during the pandemics. improvements of telecommunication technology allowed and supported people working remotely being the driving force of this trend. this work also researched and assessed on various types of technologies and apps regarding their performances in supporting remote working and projects managements. this study concluded that, the innovations and improvements of telecommunication technologies and the significantly increase of decentralised workforces could motivate the "" �work from home""� attendance style being the new normal. . this proposal[8] introduced the use of 5g in health care. figure 1[8] displayed below illustrated a series of cases of application of 5g in the fight against covid 19. this proposal suggested the implementation of lot systems and 5g technology to achieve efficient data update and provide non contact treatment. this proposal not only can achieve isolation which obey the lockdown policies, but also capable of being further developed in the post covid 19 era. with this idea, various of industries can implement their 5g based tailor fit systems which can motivate series of innovation in telecom technology. supply chain for medicine and equipment tw a t servers internet figure 1 cases of application of 5g in counter against covid 19 from proposal [8] this article[9] is another research on the application of digital technologies in public health response to covid 19. the team researched on different types digital technologies and the respective applications. a proposal of close contact alert system was proposed in this article. the proposed system utilised bluetooth technology and contact tracing app(s) to detect close contact of individuals, and users will be alerted. people's health status and contact record will be uploaded to and processed in the public health management network. citizens entering some public locations can be automatically detected and officials will be notified with their arrivals. big data technology, artificial intelligence, and iot systems are widely used in this design, which highly automated and save high amount of human resource. 2. the interdependency of telecom technology and society the development, implementation, and innovation of telecommunication technology is strongly bonded with the society. the need from the society and human culture is able to trigger rapid innovation in the field of telecommunication, and the improvement of telecommunication is capable of bringing new lifestyle to the society. this section will discuss the interdependency between telecommunication technology and society. the discussion will distribute in. how the pandemics motivate the innovation of telecommunication how does telecommunication technology change people's lifestyle, i.e., decentralise of workforces, study, and health care advantages and challenges. 2.1 motivation of telecom technology by pandemics two of the most common social discussion during the pandemics are health care and self isolation. as mentioned above, governments in many countries announced "" �self isolation""� policies, these policies required citizens to stay in their living place unless necessary events needed to perform (e.g., shopping for food, visiting a doctor, and mandatory in person attendance education). . 2.1.1 online real time video conferencing technology as the result of lockdown and (international) travel restriction, companies and factories paused their work and left progression behind, (international) students were unable to return to campus. a research| 10] was carried out in 2020, studied the impact of covid 19 on small business in some cities in usa. figure 2[10] displayed below is a screenshot of this work, illustrating the business status of the investigated companies (firms). the result indicated that 43% of the investigated companies would need to close temporarily, and 2% would close permanently. n (total) nm (answering) supply chain employee health demand orders raw data currently open 2,759 2,196 30.2 49.8 temporarily closed 2,116 1,774 x 59.7 permanently closed 100 85 . 60.8 total 4,975 4,055 . 56.8 rewelghted to census by size and region currently open 2,698 2,149 . 50.4 temporarily closed 2,080 1,744 b 60.2 permanently closed 80 1 63.6 total 4,872 3,973 t 58.1 figure 2 screenshot of the work, displaying the breakdown of companies business status in some cities in usa during pandemics [10] besides companies, students were the groups that faced the strike of the pandemics. international students that were being blocked outside of the border due to the international traveling policies, were unable to attend classes by the beginning of the pandemics. students who were unable to return had to defer suspend their studies and left behind. figure 3[11] displayed below is the screenshot of the statics performed in a research illustrating the duration (in months) of learning delay in various regions from february 2020 to january 2022. students experienced estimated 0.82 academic year's delay in average. estimated months of learning delay by region, feb 16, 2020""��jan 31, 2022 % of academic year south asia 12.4 124 latin america and caribbean 17 17 east asia and pacific middle east and north africa sub saharan africa north america europe and central asia global figure 3 screenshot of the research, displaying the estimated months of learning delay by region [11] to overcome these challenges raised after the pandemics, technologies that allowed people to conduct their work were required. zoom is a video conferencing app that is geared for business usage, it is capable of supporting real time video chat for multiple users. zoom enabled students and employees to conduct their work and study remotely, which saved students from leaving more academic years behind and helped companies to resume their work progression. zoom had become successful during the pandemic, table 1[12] listed below displays the annual net income 2018 to 2021. the success of zoom attracted society's sight to online video conferencing. society's need during pandemics had triggered the development of online real time conferencing technologies. . table 1 zoom annual net income 2018 to 2021 (smillion) [12] 2.1.2 implementation of iot systems another improvement of telecommunication technology motivated by pandemics is lot systems. the implementation and application of lot systems had a high contribution to the defence of covid 19. public healthcare and health monitoring were two of the focus points during pandemics, which included (but not limited). close contact tracing, body temperature detection, and monitoring and delivering of vaccines. after the announcements of public distancing (isolation lockdown) policies, accessible human resources were minimized, public healthcare facilities like hospitals often reported facing overwhelming of patients[ 13]. systems that are automated or operated by patients or visitors were required to ease the need of professionals. therefore, lot systems were widely implemented. iot systems are sets of devices that connected to the internet, have the capability of detecting certain parameters, reacting according to the situation, and performing data sharing and analysis|[ 14]. the application of lot systems can be implemented to (but not limited). smart thermometers, drones, and patient health status monitoring. early diagnosis to some symptoms of covid have sufficient assist to the professionals in control of the spread of the virus, these symptoms included. cough, fever, sore throat, unable to smell or taste, etc. fever is the symptoms that can be easily detected, many public locations announced policies that body temperatures needed to be examined before entering. a system with a high resolution ir sensor or a high resolution ir camera implemented to the internet enabled smart board, can be used to detect body temperature of individuals or groups. with the further implementation of id card scanners, this system can identify the visitors and pass this information along with the recorded body temperature to the data management system for analysis. this type of lot enabled body temperature detecting system was widely used in china in the defence against covid 19 by implementing at the entrance of the hospitals[15]. 2.1.3 application of drones drones were another successful telecom technology during pandemics. due to the fact that governments were short on human resources in public healthcare, and the professionals were fully assigned, there was needs for drones to finish the miscellaneous works, e.g., notification to citizens regarding the planned covid virus testing, and important transportation jobs like delivery of medical supplies and medicines within hospitals, sanitation of public places, delivery of vaccines in cities without efficient transport, etc. india is a large country with population about 1.4 billion. these citizens were served by roughly 30,000 healthcare centres, however, at least 5 10% of them were inaccessible to medical supplier due to geographic locations and natural disasters. the world economic forum initiated the project "" �medicine from the sky""� in 2019, and received sufficient outcome during the pandemics. drones were used in delivery of vaccines and medicines beyond the visual range, which is a demonstration of successful use of cutting edge drone technology[16]. the first pandemic was confirmed in january 2020 in wuhan, china had taken fast response and initiated sanitation for streets and living districts in cities. drones that were originally designed for pesticides spraying in farming, were utilised in the sanitation processes. similar to india, drones were also utilised in delivery of medical supplies and vaccines in china| 17]. 2.2 impact of telecom technology to society this section will discuss the impact of telecommunication technology to the society. as the pandemics affected society in various ways and brought up the needs of citizens, telecommunication technology solved these challenges and brought these technologies to people's sight, these ordinary . technologies had become popular and well known to the society in these days. telecommunication technology have changed people's lifestyle in many ways during the pandemics and the post pandemic era. among these changes, one of the most significant are. decentralise of workforces, education, and healthcare. as discussed above, online real time video conferencing apps had become the saviour to some companies and students who were unable to conduct their work during pandemics, the app zoom was the most outstanding among these. zoom had reported[ 18] the outcome of a survey in its blog reflecting the affirmative of using video conferencing across various industries. e healthcare. 67% of businesses surveyed agree with companies were considering a flexible remote working model as successful remote collaboration with video conferencing| 18] education. there was 3.5 times increased in the use of video conferencing solutions during pandemics| 18] technology. 84% of businesses surveyed agreed with video conferencing would remain being essential in the post pandemic era[18] professional services. there was 2.7 times increased in remote working during pandemics| 18]. table 2[12] below is the daily meeting participants from 2019 to 2022. the result listed above and the table below show that, zoom still maintained high number of users and have high potential of partially replace traditional in person attendance working studying type. table 2 daily meeting participants 2019 to 2022 [12] improvement of telecommunication technology also impacted healthcare services. healthcare system had gradually evolved to decentralize, e.g., telemedicine, home care, and mobile health unit. telemedicine is an example of decentralize of healthcare, with the use of internet and some communication enabled hardware, specialists can receive medical imaging and perform remote medical diagnosis, evaluation, and video consultation. there exist other technologies that are telecom enabled and promoting decentralize of healthcare, e.g., mobile dialysis units, mobile ante natal care and vaccination units, etc. these technologies had been widely used during the pandemics and will be further developed in the post pandemic era. 2.3 benefits and challenges the improvement in telecommunication technology had provided various of solutions to businesses, students, and governments in their need of workforces, catch up the progress, and defending this global crisis. this improvement and innovation also promoted the society shifting to a decentralized working studying environment. even if citizens are living in the post pandemic era, there still be the risk of infecting virus, a remote working studying and healthcare environment can ease this risk, at the meantime, decentralised working style has lower cost than traditional in person attending working style. however, challenges still exist for decentralised workforce and telecom technology. telecom technology in nowadays often come in wireless, issues like signal strength, covering range, and transmission latency are the challenges in the implementation of telecom technology. besides technical challenges, ethical issues like security of privacy could trigger arguments in the society. decentralised workforce could bring up issues like poor coordination, lack of management, difficulties in delivering emergency decisions, and decentralization of some industries is impossible. 3. conclusion . in conclusion, the improvement of telecom technology and the society formed up an interdependency. telecommunication technology had improved, innovated and caught more sight of the society, as the contribution in supporting remote working, studying and healthcare was significant during and after pandemics, its further development assisted and promoted the decentralised workforces in the society. society benefited from the improvement and wide implementation of telecom technology and entering a decentralised working style. reference list [1] d. b. taylor, ""a timeline of the coronavirus pandemic,"" the new york times, news march 17, 2021 2021.

8,62,1462,"abstract with new technological innovations every day and automation becoming more involved in our daily lives, engineers and scientists are working more on making the world of artificial intelligence. the main aspect of making the artificial intelligence and automation more efficient is to terminate the human labour and making everyday tasks hands free. however, with automation it means the jobs of the middle class talents are depreciating. the works which required heavy lifting or some tasks which were done repeatedly on a daily basis are going to be done by robots. with careful consideration of advancing the automation sector and encouraging the future talents to concentrate on various other skills can be a solution to unemployment up to a certain level. this document outlines the upside and the downside of the impact of automation on our future society and the job prospect of the middle class talents. introduction building software that does many sets of tasks by learning from the experience it obtains via numerous sets of training rather than adhering to only a few sets of logic and rules is known as artificial intelligence or "" �machine learning""�. artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining popularity over the past few years and current figures show that from 2015 to 2019 there was a 270% increase inthe number of firms using al. numerous reasons contributed to its rise. these robots, for instance, are seen to mimic human behaviour (in terms of labour and tasks) and the are less prone to experience typical human issues like exhaustion and disease. because if this, using a robot to complete the same task is more efficient than using a person, resulting in lower total costs. even if most duties will soon be carried out by machines, making life simpler for mankind, there are still lot of individuals who feel threatened since they may potentially be replaced by robots in the near future. the question that now arises is whether or not people will be able to adapt to the new roles that are expected to become available once the world reaches such an era and whether machines will truly take over all of the work and leave nothing for them. al in recent time the lethal corona virus has been a problem for the world during the past few years. in order to avoid social gatherings as much as possible at this period, the majority of individuals abandoned their employment globally. unfortunately, the likelihood of these people recovering fromtheir job loss, that is, gaining their employment back, is slim given the advent of al and the possibility that the lethal virus may persist in some form for many years to come. according to one report, corona virus caused toll collectors in san francisco bay area to lose their jobs. to make matters worse for these individuals, tolls can now be collected through the e tag that is mounted on the windshields of the . majority of vehicles or bills can be mailed to the individuals home. the surge in automation between 1990 and 2007 is also said to have resulted in the loss of roughly 400000 employment in american manufacturers. however, this figure is expected to increase more quickly as most businesses attempt to recover from the pandemic and coronavirus losses by shifting towards a workplace that employs fewer people and more technology to take the place of the human labour. cleaning staff in public spaces employees at restaurants and convenience stores, and customer service representatives are more examples of occupations that have been replaced by machines. it is anticipated that smart machines and robots would eventually take over the majority of low skilled labour occupations, displacing humans. automation in future society according to a forbes article, the world economic forum (wef) concluded that a new generation of intelligent robots created with the aid of al and robotics may be able to replace a significant number of humans and employees. according to current figures, 30% of all occupations worldwide are performed by machines or robots. if this number increases, the ratio of human to robot jobs will be equal worldwide. although it has been claimed in several news articles and academic studies that as more robots replace simple tasks and responsibilities with more complex ones, people would have access to new career prospects and roles, maintaining the balance. tackling unemployment the increase in intelligent robots and machines, which will eventually displace the majority of human workers, will also provide a lot of new career possibilities that deal with handling such technology. as the number of robots and machines increases, more workers are needed for tasks like machine maintenanc. therefore, it could be necessary to teach individuals when the time comes, allowing the majority of those whose occupations were eliminated by intelligent robots to choose a new professional path. once successful, these individuals are less likely to experience unemployment since, according to recent data, there will undoubtedly be a large need for someone who can do maintenance on our primary workforce (i.e., the robots). however, the issue arises. how many individuals who lost their employment have a degree that will enable them to get educated to be able to perform successfully for those new job chances? new job opportunities will undoubtedly appear after al replaces the majority of currently accessible occupations. contrary to those who hold undergraduate or doctoral degrees, middle and working class persons without degrees were more likely to be harmed by the growth of al. the likelihood that everyone will be retrained in the future is still questionable because the majority of these people find it difficult to find the chance to learn new skills and stay current with cutting edge technologies. . why we need automation and al? despite all the debates and concerns about the development of artificial intelligence, there are a few minor benefits beyond labour cost reduction and the fact that it is not subject to any human limitations like disease or exhaustion. for instance, since robots and computers created using deep machine learning and artificial intelligence use historical data to generate precise predictions and reach extremely accurate decisions . given that people make mistakes and errors frequently, this can significantly minimise human error. additionally, research shows that artificial intelligence (al) can study and use data gleaned from sources in real time, cutting down on the amount of time needed to examine data and information to resolve difficult issues. additionally, occupations requiring a lot of risk, like dangerous exploration in mines, etc., frequently struggle with a labour shortage because people shouldn t perform those tasks. machines, on the other hand, do not have the same physical limitations as humans, which allows us to successfully obtain usable commodities from mines. additionally, as most surveys show, most people may have trouble managing their emotions, which can occasionally lead to them making biased judgements. since machines don t need a heart to function, this isn t the case. conclusion after studying several case studies, i ve come to the conclusion that there are both benefits and drawbacks to the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence and machine deep learning. al undoubtedly offers advantages of its own and has the potential to improve the world. however, how the higher ups manage the progress of al in terms of job possibilities will be crucial. it takes a lot of time and effort to train someone, particularly if they lack the necessary background knowledge. it will be challenging for those without degrees who are most likely to be impacted by the development of artificial intelligence and deep machine learning to understand how to perform maintenance on complicated technology like intelligent robots and machines. we are left wondering who will provide for their family throughout that extended period of training as they are unable to work or make money during that time. there are still far too many questions that need to be clarified. lt would be sage to promote and retrain the majority of threatened employees while they still have jobs in order to ensure that the globe can go ahead for successfully in terms of technology. thus, they will be able to change right away. . reference [1] ben vermulen, jan kesselhut, andreas pyka and paolo saviotti , ""

9,23,1476,"abstract. the term ""automation"" refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in operations. when decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and associated actions are predetermined and implemented in machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. in this essay, we will talk about how automation has affected the lives of daily working people in both, a positive and negative way. introduction. the pace of technology development and application is currently at an all time high. it is highly noticeable that significant changes are occurring. whole industries are adapting to new advancements, eliminating the need for many jobs that need human labor. these jobs could be altogether gone in the near future. other vocations are seeing a sharp rise in demand at the same time, and some are changing the skill sets they historically needed. discussions on this subject are frequently divisive and welcome the chance to raise living standards and the quality of the products, while opponents express deep worry about the significant loss of employment. but not all industries are equally affected by these technological advancements. fig 1. manufacturing companies in the past (barely automated) . fig 2. manufacturing companies presently (fully automated) body. i. middle class struggles older or less educated displaced workers have a higher propensity to quit their jobs than retrain their current career instead of applying for other careers. for these employees, the idea of going back to a 2 or 4 year college to pick up a new skill or beginning a low wage entry level job as a trainee is incredibly unpleasant ""�� and may not be worth it if they only have a decade or two left to work. people who struggled academically in their younger years and only managed to earn a high school certificate are particularly bad prospects for continuing their education. a lifetime of low paying labor may deter individuals from ever taking on another position if they are faced with that possibility [1]. il. the effect of artificial intelligence (ati) artificial intelligence (ai) has a considerably larger potential to infiltrate jobs that were previously performed solely by humans, there is a big ger possibility of future job losses for the vast majority of the middle class. robots and other types of automation will likely be able to carry out jobs that have traditionally been performed by people because of al s capacity to recognize, understand and learn patterns in the real world and in human interactions as well. al also has a huge capacity to learn over time and adapt as necessary to any given situations [1]. millions of occupations that formerly offered middle class salaries to their employees may soon be eliminated due to the automation of certain functions, such operating a motor vehicle in traffic or responding to client inquiries and complaints in retail and service companies. the most common example of this we see is the automated email responses that we get from big companies, which are normally friendly and thankful emails. additionally, as robot dexterity increases, they will be able to carry out a variety of physical tasks in jobs ranging from manufacturing to handling inventories and delivering goods, as well as a variety of analytical tasks in the fields of accounting, finance, legal services, and health care that previously required professional degrees [2]. . il cult ws mean probability of automation  fig 3. automation and work displacement by occupation i1l.benefits of automation the benefits of automation include. (i) productivity gains (greater output per hour of labor input), (ii) higher quality products, (iii) | scrap reduction (particularly beneficial for costly raw material), (iv) | added security (due to operator taking the supervisory role instead of active and direct physical participation), (v) a shorter lead time for production, (vi) inventory reduction for work in progress, etc. automating dangerous and repetitive work is usually useful. with increasing automation, human error is completely removed, product quality is enhanced, rejections are minimized, costs are decreased, and eventually, people s standard of life is raised.[3][5] iv.what can be done to help the middle class? disadvantaged employees will require greater assistance, such as career counselling and childcare, to finish such schooling. additionally, online education has to advance if it is to offer access to skill development for people who must maintain a full time job while pursuing their education. in fact, many more workers may require ""lifelong learning"" accounts to pay for such training. as a result, authorities ought to think about providing subsidies to companies that retrain employees while levying fines on companies who permanently fire people in reaction to automation. [6] we also have to deal with two more issues. first, if businesses often replace employees without retraining them, we must ensure that these replaced individuals can obtain another ""good job"" to replace the ones that they lost. these ""good jobs"" should have a good salary, the opportunity for promotion, and some degree of employment stability. employer mandates can also be successful, but they should not be very burdensome or expensive to the point where they encourage firms to automate more quickly. secondly, in order to ""make work pay,"" employees may want an improved package of benefits, such as expanded paid time off and better childcare . options. they may also require wage insurance, which helps to make up some of the lost wages for displaced workers. these will motivate employees to accept new positions even if some pay less than the ones they lose.[6] the impact of al automation on jobs =e loss === gain ""��""��net no. of jobs 5,000,000 4,000,000 3,000,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 #2022 2023 2024 #â« â©2025 fig 4. job losses post automation v.what does the future look like? the way we work will change as a result of automation and technology, claims a mckinsey analysis. they believe that in order to get job, employees may require a variety of talents across europe. according to their scenario, by 2030, jobs that primarily demand manual dexterity and physical strength would decrease by 18%, while jobs that require fundamental cognitive abilities will decrease by 28%. workers will require technology abilities, and those with experience in stem fields will be especially needed. similar to this, many jobs will require socioemotional abilities, especially those requiring caregiving and education, two jobs for which robots are not suitable replacements .[7] robots may potentially be seen as a more significant aspect of our daily lives. many routine jobs in our homes, including cooking and cleaning, may be fully automated. similar to self driving vehicles and digital assistants, robots that are capable of computer vision and natural language processing may enable more complex interactions with the outside world. the future of medicine might potentially be influenced by robotics. with improvements in artificial intelligence (ai), surgical robots may one day be able to execute procedures independently. in the end, robots have the capacity to improve our quality of life. they may be able to relieve us of the strain of physically taxing or repetitive chores as well as advance healthcare, increase the effectiveness of transportation, and allow us more flexibility to engage in creative activities.[7] . conclusion. in conclusion, automation is a cause for the struggles of the middle class people, however, with good early education up till a bachelor's level, these struggles can be avoided. another alternate solution for people who are closer to retirement would not want to spend money and time on 2 4 year courses when they would be retiring within the next decade would be, offering them a stable job with good incentives which would make them want to change jobs instead of pushing them into an early retirement. however, the crux of the matter is that, the workplace shift from manual to automation is inevitable and will happen in the foreseeable future, which has more upsides than downsides, thus providing a good change, therefore, as long as we learn to work with robots and be accepting of change these struggles can be avoided. . reference list.

27,78,1286,"mass transit in urban centres and their limitations in a pandemic abstract mass transit is the primary method of travel for millions of people each year in sydney alone. the sydney trains suburban rail lines is one fo the most extensive in the world and connects the sprawling suburbs with the cbd. the pandemic shows that there are limitations in an often packed public transport system. . table of contents introduction the importance of mass transit pandemic limitations references . introduction a key part of a modern urban centre is the mass transit system, moving people in bulk across the city centre and the greater metropolitan area. for instance, observe the greater sydney area which stretches from the beaches of the eastern suburbs up to the base of the blue mountains approximately 60 kilometres away. the sydney trains passenger rail network spans over 813 kilometres of track, servicing 170 stations across 8 rail lines.[1] the network over the year spanning 2020 2021, the network saw an annual ridership of 195 million people. [2] the importance of the mass transit system in an urban environment is self evident, especially as populations continue to grow, road networks become congested and fuel prices continue to rise amongst concerns regarding climate change. however, mass transit by definition transports large numbers of people in one vehicle resulting in a packed environment. perfect conditions for the transmission of airborne diseases such as the sars cov 2 virus, more commonly known as corona virus or covid, in the ongoing pandemic since early 2020. mass transit is most cost efficient when each vehicle is filled to sitting and standing capacity, which is not conducive to social distancing measures introduced during the pandemic. this essay will explore the importance of mass transit in high density urban zones and the effects of a pandemic on this system. this essay will primarily focus on the mass transit system of sydney, australia which is operated by transport for nsw. this photo by unknown author is licensed under cc by nc nd figure 1 sydney central station . the importance of mass transit public transport is defined as "" �the system that is used for moving large numbers of people on buses, trains, etc.""� [3] a modern mass transit public transport system often consists of a mix of railways and buses, and in the case of coastal riverine cities, ferries. in the case of sydney, the mass transit system consists of an extensive suburban railway network along with an equally expansive bus service as well as ferries, a recently expanded light rail network and the autonomous sydney metro. according to the 2021 census by the australian bureau of statistics (abs), sydney has a population of 5,231,147 people [4]. the mass transit network allows for low cost transport, providing a viable alternative to private transport and all the costs associated with it from purchasing a private vehicle to high petrol prices. this also helps with congestion on the road network as mass transit is capable of transporting many times more people in the same space as an equivalent amount of personal vehicles. = sepooouptt taa this photo by unknown author is licensed under cc by nc nd figure 2 177 people and the space they take on a road in various methods of transport. . besides taking up much less space, mass transit enables economic development by bringing interconnectivity between locations that are otherwise impractical to reach without some means of transport. mass transit links allow people to live some distance away from their workplaces. for example, an office worker working in the sydney cbd could avoid the high property prices of the inner city and instead live in developing areas such as rouse hill in the north west thanks to both an express bus link and the metro line. parking spaces are also in high demand in the sydney cbd with relatively cramped and narrow streets which makes for difficult navigation in a private vehicle, further increasing the attractiveness of the mass transit system. with a city circle rail line and a light rail line that stretches from circular quay and down the main road of the cbd area, there is plenty of transport capacity and coverage for easy movement across the cbd without the use of cars or walking times exceeding 5 minutes. this photo by unknown author is licensed under cc by sa nc figure 3 sydney l1 light rail line tram at market city near darling harbour . pandemic limitations as mentioned previously in this essay, a mass transit system is more efficient when each vehicle in the system is filled with as many people as possible. packed trains during peak hours are a common sight in cities around the globe and are not unique to sydney. unfortunately with so many people in a cramped space and not a lot of ventilation other than the air conditioning system, airborne diseases can be quickly spread. one public health measure taken during the pandemic is the practice of social distancing where people maintain a distance of 1.5m from each other. this greatly reduces the capacity of mass transit as more space must be allocated to each passenger. for example, the 2021 annual report from sydney trains shows an average of 659,000 passenger journeys per weekday during covid which is down from 1.3 1.4 million journeys pre covid [2]. it is an unfortunate reality that the efficiency of a mass transit system will be severely impacted in a pandemic or any other event that requires more than the bare minimum amount of room needed for a person to stand. in addition to social distancing, self isolation or otherwise simply working from home drastically reduces the amount people travelling at all. as ridership numbers fall, revenue falls with it and thus increases the cost of operating a mass transit system which in turn could lead to a reduction in services. this does not take into account any potential driver shortage due to the need for self isolation. figure 4 a sydney metro train filled to capacity. picture courtesy of the australian broadcasting corporation (abc) a mass transit system is superfluous if it cannot transport people en mass, but to do so during a pandemic is highly unwise and would facilitate further outbreaks as a single infected person is placed in close proximity to dozens of fellow passengers. . conclusion in a modern city where the greater metropolitan area and suburbia sprawls for dozens of kilometres away from the city centre, a mass transit system is crucial to connecting the entirety of the metropolitan area into a single cohesive whole as opposed to a large collection of independent townships with a single urban centre that is vaguely associated with them. a mass transit system is also at its most effective when each vehicle is filled to its maximum seating and standing capacity, moving hundreds of people at a time. but such conditions are highly conducive to infection of airborne diseases such as the virus sars cov 2, commonly known as covid. ultimately for as long as people live in urban centres and the workforce does not decentralise into remote working as the new norm, a mass transit system will remain key to the continued economic development of a city and its metropolitan area. however, a pandemic can easily turn the mass transit system into a mass infection zone where a single infected person may unknowingly spread it to hundreds of people. references [1]""routes and timetables"", transport, 2022.

4,8,1335,"micro power grids and waste management grids for sustainable living abstract. as the populations throughout the world continue to expand the need for electricity and the amount of overall waste as garbage has expanded. this volume of growth of waste includes both non organic and organic waste, some of which are non recyclable or renewable. natural disasters have occurred often over the past few decades, costing numerous lives, livelihoods, and other serious losses. within the last 10 years much research has been done into how climate change and our requirement for energy plus waste creation has been a contributing factor. waste products are generally disposed of through a process of recycling, but many waste products need to be burned incinerated to process them. the process of waste disposal is often overlooked and results in dumping of this waste in areas where it effects the ecological life of the area or in areas it is not intended. a major concern has been the impact on marine life and how the consumption of waste products can cause injury and death. it may be easy to believe that dumping a small amount of rubbish into the sea would not have much of an impact on the environment but long term the impact is critical. similarly, the disposal of household waste in large tips landfill areas also has a negative impact on the environment, especially if the area also resides in close vicinity to residential areas, this is mainly due to the possible emittance of toxic fumes and the possibility of bad occurs. throughout history many different processes have been created to produce energy. reliability and efficiency have always been the key, focusing on generating the most amount of energy as possible from the single system. when electricity was first discovered the amount of energy required was not a major concern but as the world's population grew so did the requirement for more energy. majority of the energy sources we have utilised over time (coal, nuclear) have now been discovered to have terrible long term effects to the environment which has effects that now cannot be changed. this . includes pockets within the earth's ozone layer which assists in regulating the uv transfer between the sun and the earth etc. there is always energy loss when transferring electricity from huge power plants that provide electricity for communities to these communities and customers who require the electricity. power plants must work harder to fulfil the expectations of the communities or consumers who depend on this electricity because most power plants use non renewable sources of energy. this implies that waste materials and dangerous gases are discharged into the environment. given all these problems, there is some discussion about how to ensure a sustainable way of life in terms of waste management and power production while yet being financially feasible. introduction. finally, some novel ideas for producing energy that can fulfil consumer demand while being greener and more efficient are beginning to emerge. man s neglect in the correct disposal of garbage and the inability to create power effectively result in new problems every day. trash management techniques exist that can reduce the quantity utilised by up to 90% and separate materials from waste things that could be used again to make particular goods, hence decreasing the need to re source or manufacture this material. in time, this lowers carbon footprint, which is great for the environment. this essay will look at the societal and experiential effects of these modern sustainable living practises. we ll focus on the benefits and drawbacks of employing waste management and micro power grids. unfortunately, even procedures that don t represent a major threat will have downsides, therefore it s crucial that we remain aware of them. body. micro power grids are local energy grids that are tiny enough to operate independently of a larger scale power grid. a benefit of these is that both renewable and non renewable energy sources can be used as a main power source for the micro power systems. geothermal, wind, solar, and hydropower are examples of renewable energy resources. these are the recommended energy sources since they use the earth s renewable natural . resources, which are beneficial to the environment, and produce relatively little waste during energy production. oil, natural gas, and other fossil fuels are easily available non renewable energy sources that are already in use. all these sources have disadvantages that increase pollution and other negative effects. there are many advantages and disadvantages of utilising micro power grids. advantages include reliability, construction and setup time, cheaper running costs and it creates jobs for workers. since most micro power grids use renewable energy sources, they are more dependable than those that use non renewable energy sources and depend on their fuel sources to arrive regularly. in the event of a power outage caused by a natural disaster, micro power grids which are greatly stable are generally simpler and much easier to repair maintain where required. due to their small size, they are able to be constructed and setup in a smaller timespan meaning they can get to work quicker. they need substantially less energy and labour to run because they are small scale power plants. additionally, there is relatively little energy waste because to the short distance that energy must travel to reach the user. as a result, the grid requires less energy to run and therefore cheaper running costs. as noted, the micro power grids also bring further job growth into smaller communities where required. the fact that batteries are needed to store the electrical energy generated is one of the downsides of micro power networks. interconnection standards are necessary to provide uniformity across all micropower grids. since the idea is still relatively new and implementation will take some time, certain communities could become weary of them being used right now. another technique is to use grid systems for garbage management. with time, it becomes increasingly clear that garbage is being disposed of in a way that causes less environmental damage and less contamination. the most well liked and efficient way to handle waste is recycling, which has been around for a while. other methods of garbage disposal include burning the rubbish and utilising a system that uses a magnetised system to gather recyclable metals so they may be recycled again. such solutions help people live more ecologically responsible lives while also being very beneficial to communities. . conclusion. generally speaking, the development of micro power grids and waste management has many positive effects on human civilisation. micro power grids and trash management technologies provide some promise for developing a sustainable way of living because humanity has been used to long utilising non renewable sources of energy and careless rubbish disposal for too long. we are glad to have the natural resources that can be utilised to generate renewable energy, therefore it is imperative that we employ them now, before the damage is too great to reverse. we need to be ready to keep up with the changes that come with establishing these systems into operation in order for us to reach a certain level of sustainability, and we must make every effort to do so. we are, after all, protecting the planet in which we live. even though these methods may have some difficulties, overall, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. therefore, it is anticipated that communities would take into account the advantages and take prompt, action to keep our world healthy. . references. energy .gov. 2022. how microgrids work.

1,35,1296,"public transport and pandemics in australia 2.1 history of public transport in australia 2.2 benefits of public transport 2.3 coronavirus disease (covid 19) covid 19 and public transport 3.1 public transport during the pandemic 3.2. impact of covid 19 on public transport conclusion . abstract public transport has always played a major role in the growth and development of australia's economy. providing alternate modes of transport creates equal ity by reducing social exclusion and transport disadvantages. public transport provides access to recreational services, health and education facilities, and employment opportunities. the recent covid 19 pandemic has had a major impact on australia's public transportation network, with significant changes to the nation's trans port usage. the key findings of this article are that while the public is more interested in domestic travel post pandemic, fear of covid 19 is still a strong deterrent to using public transport. . introduction 1.1 public transport public transportation provides an alternate travel method to use of private vehicles, available for use by the general public. these systems are usually managed on a schedule and operate on pre established routes. mediums of public transport include trams, busses, passenger trains, and rapid transit rail (e.g. metro or subway). 1.2 pandemics a pandemic is defined as a worldwide spread of a new disease. the spread of a disease can be affected by several factors, including human to human transmission and means of transportation. once a pandemic has been declared, it is up to a country to implement the appropriate disease control strategies to minimise spread within the population. . public transport and pandemics in australia 2.1 history of public transport in australia urban transport needs in australia were quite small in the 1800s the popula tion of the largest city, sydney, was only about 50 thousand. the majority of urban trips were done by walking, with a small percentage by horse. however, this changed dramatically with the gold rush in 1850. the influx of workers and money triggered a rapid growth in urbanisation in australia. initially, mass passenger transport in the state capitals consisted of horses, horse buses, wag onettes and horse powered trams. urban roads were introduced by the 1860s, and mechanical transportation was adopted by the 1880s with the adoption of steam trams in sydney and cable trams in melbourne. by the 1940s, syd ney and melbourne accounted for close to 90% of the total metropolitan train travel in australia [1, pg. 3]. petrol buses started becoming more widespread in australia in the 1920s, and by 1945 public transport across all mediums was approaching 2 billion passenger trips per year |1, pg. 4]. following the second world war, australia's public transport system had to contend with the growing availability of private cars. most capital cities (except melbourne) closed their tram networks and replaced them with bus services. 2.2 benefits of public transport public transport plays an important role in the productivity of an urbanised society. mass transit provides an alternate means of travel to private vehicles, and plays an important role in moving skills and labour between markets. public transport systems also play a major role is reducing urban congestion the estimated avoidable cost of traffic congestion in australia in 2010 was $12.9 billion [2, pg. 4]. . figure |. metropolitan passenger trips for australia, across all modes, 1900 2013 â© walk | meycle â© private horse | m ferry | slight rail | mheavy rail bbus | @ motorcycle â® commercial road vehicles | @car â° ples leslie lpp ipp lili oli lip leo ls figure 2.1. metropolitan passenger trips for australia, across all modes, 1900 2013 (bitre) private motor vehicle usage accounts for close to 90% of vehicle usage in australia [1, pg. 2]. where transport ranks as the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions at 18.7% as of 2022, behind electricity and station ary electricity [3, pg. 9]. where one train on sydney's railways can remove approximately 1,000 cars from the road [2, pg. 4], public transport systems can help to significantly reduce carbon emissions. 2.3 coronavirus disease (covid 19) the coronavirus disease, caused by the sars cov 2 virus, had an undeni able impact on australia's economy. the unemployment rate rose to 7.1% in may 2020 [4, pg. 9]. the economy fell 7.0% in june 2020, and the accommo dation and food services industry recorded the largest drop in employment at 17.6%, followed by the manufacturing industry and professional, scientific and technical services (6.5% and 4.5% respectively.) [4, pg. 22}. sept 2022 . covid 19 and public transport 3.1 public transport during the pandemic the coronavirus disease pandemic has had a major impact on australia's economy, particularly on the tourism and travel sectors. international visits were down 40% (1.8 million visitors) between january and june 2020 compared to the same period the prior year, which resulted in an average of a $2 billion loss per month in total tourism receipts [5, pg. 2]. public transport patronage in late march to mid may 2020 across all the capital cities dropped to 10 30% of normal activity [6, pg. 4]. studies show that during may 2020, 59% were uncomfortable with travelling to work using public transport, and in june 2020 nsw public transport was running at only 50% of the usual patronage [6, pg. 5). 3.2. impact of covid 19 on public transport in the wake of the pandemic, seven in ten expect to use a private car for leisure travel, compared to two in five who would use public transport [{7, p. 20]. enforcing social distancing through restricting passenger numbers is not feasible in the long run. surveys show that over 70% of australians believe that face masks should be mandatory on public transport, and 86% of australians believe that public transport poses a moderate to high risk of covid 19 transmission [6, pg. 8]. in addition, over 60% believe that more needs to be done to encourage the public to use mass transit and to raise public awareness that covid safety measures are in place {6, pg. 8}. . conclusion the reluctance of the general public to use public transport systems and lean ing towards private vehicles will lead to higher congestion and environment pollution in high density urban areas. this will be exacerbated by the return of peak hour traffic lower patronage may result in higher costs to public trans port fares in order to offset the lower business levels. on the other hand, the burden may fall to businesses to encourage flexible work hours or offer back to work plans to promote the usage of public transport. municipalities may look at encouraging alternate modes of transport, such as walking, dedicated bicycle tracks, e bike and e scooter programs, or even re evaluate fuel options such as zero emission buses, or new transport types such as trackless trams. as mentioned above, public transport networks can look at raising public aware ness of safety protocols to lessen public fears of catching covid 19 on public transport. . bibliography (1) bureau of infrastructure and transport research economics (bitre). long term trends in urban public transport. pages 1 ""�� 35, 2014. url https . https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Oo4UC71R63C6WQ04Fvsb-M?domain=bitre.gov.au sites default files is 060.pdf. tourism and transport forum (ttf). the benefits of public transport. pages 2""�� 5, 2010. url https. https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/s4HCC81Vq2CMwzADcmohzV?domain=ttf.org.au wp content uploads 2016 06 ttf the benefits of public transport 2010.pdf. the environment department of climate change, energy and wa ter (dcceew). quarterly update of australia's national green house gas inventory. march 2022. pages 1 ""�� 40, 2022. url https . https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/4vWtC91W8rCKYM6LsLiNZF?domain=dcceew.gov.au sites default files documents nggi quarterly update march 2022.pdf. national skills commission. the shape of australia's post covid 19 work force. pages 1 ""��64, 2020. url https. www.nationalskillscommission. gov.au sites default files 2021 12 nsc 20shape%,20o0f , 20australias 20post ,20covid 19%,20workforce 1.pdf. tourism and â€˜transport forum (ttf). estimated impact of coronavirus on the australian visitor economy. pages 1 ""�� 10, 2020. url https. https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/s4HCC81Vq2CMwzADcmohzV?domain=ttf.org.au wp content uploads 2020 03 economic impact of coronavirus ttf. pdf. tourism and â€˜transport forum (ttf). transport systems in a â€˜covid 19 normal' world. pages 1 ""�� 11, 2020. url https . https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/s4HCC81Vq2CMwzADcmohzV?domain=ttf.org.au wp content uploads 2020 12 k579 public transport ""��paper v0o7web 2.pdf. p.partalis s. vercoe, k. mcgowan. ttf covid 19 travel & leisure insights. 2020. url https. https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/s4HCC81Vq2CMwzADcmohzV?domain=ttf.org.au wp content uploads 2020 06 ttf travel sentiment survey. pdf."
10,0,1500,"rapid growth in accessibility to online content abstract the exponential improvement of telecom technology and high availability of data and access to the world wide web has affected our day to day lives. technology now plays a role in every person s life from when they are born until they pass away. toddlers are introduced to screens at an early age, teenagers are dependent on social media for interaction, young and professional adults use it to work from anywhere in the world, the senior generation use it to keep in touch with friends and family that might have moved across the globe and everyone uses the content online for entertainment. while this rapid growth in technology has greatly improved many lives, many of the drawbacks have not been noticed until recently. due to all the benefits of these advancements, many of us have chosen to turn a blind eye on how it also negatively affects our lives and development. introduction nearly 65% of the world population today, or 5 billion people, have access to the internet. due to continuous growth in mobile phone users, 94% of the people with access to the internet are now also active social media users. the estimation for average time spent online for an internet user is 7 hours each day [1]. research done by the kaiser family foundation, who have conducted three studies into social media usage habits of young teens aged from 8 to 18 years old since 1999, indicate that in 2009 this age group spent the equivalent of nearly 10 % hours online each day, 7 days a week, in comparison to 7 2 hours each day in 2004 [2]. that is, in 2009, most teenagers spent nearly 75 hours a week online, nearly double the time an average adult spends working in a week. currently the guidelines for screen time usage in children and adolescents is less than 2 hours a day. however in western countries where data is more available such as australia, us, canada and new zealand, 70% do not meet this guideline [3,4]. this consistent increase in screen time usage over the last two decades could not be possible without the rapid growth in technology and telecommunication around the world. we need better understanding and education of the effects these rapid changes are having on our societies and us as individuals today. from toddlers to young adults the exponential growth and availability of smart devices has made them an integral part of our daily lives. considering only smartphones, 1433 million devices were sold to end users in 2021, while only 122 million devices were sold in 2007 [5]. there is no doubt that these devices are powerful tools in bettering our societies, but like any other tool, they can be misused and be destructive. toddlers today are introduced to screens and smart devices at very early stages of life. early development for toddlers and children is an integral part to building who they are in society. cognitive development is highly effective and efficient when experienced live, interactively, in real time and space, and with real people. infants and toddlers have difficulty learning from a screen (a 2d representation of life) [9]. due to high availability, 75% of infants start viewing tv by 4 months of age, by 2 years of age this number is increased to 90% [6]. many parents commonly use screen time as entertainment for toddlers and children. reasons as to why parents do not follow health guidelines on this matter vary but some common ones include, "" �good for their brains""�, avoiding conflict, cannot afford resources such as daycare or distracting the children so that other tasks can be accomplished [8]. many of us would know of a 2 4 year old which can roughly navigate their way around a touch screen device even though they ca not read due to being overexposed to smart devices at early stages and left without supervision. research suggests that by age 2, well designed tv programs which are age appropriate can prove beneficial to learning. early evidence also suggests that screens may help with language learning when content is co viewed and discussed with a caregiver [9]. while there appears to be some possible benefits, the risks for development in children under the age of 5 who have a high exposure to screen time are more significant. what type of early life stimuli a child receives could affect development of executive function (ef) and attentional capacity [10]. ef is an important skill for any person to be independent. evidence also suggests that there is a relationship between high exposure to screens in early childhood to feelings of victimisation, social isolation, proactive aggression, antisocial behaviours and self regulation . difficulties in middle school [9]. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) appears to also be a problem among young adults who grew up spending long hours computer gaming. screen time could take away time from other activities which better stimulate cognitive abilities and longer attention spans [12]. as such, many of these at risk children will suffer from ef and adhd as a young adult. some of these young adults later on struggle with depression and suicidal behaviour for thinking they are different. if not guided and educated in the healthy use of these technologies, bad habits will follow these children through adolescents. a headspace national youth mental health survey found that 57% of young people believe their mental health is getting worse with 42% citing social media as the main reason [11]. today nearly every person older than 12 years old has access to a multimedia platform, mobile phones. being connected to the world is easy and everything is just at your fingertips. from your bed you can talk to anyone, order food and clothes, watch anything or even work. although at first glance this only seems advantageous to our everyday lives, the impacts on our psychological and physiological health also needs to be considered. sleep is critical to neurodevelopment of infants and toddlers and plays a vital role in youths physical and mental health. evening and night time exposure to bright and blue light suppresses melatonin production which in return affects our bodies biological timing [12]. poor sleep quality in adolescents is known to contribute to depression, anxiety and low self esteem [13]. social media networks are designed to grab our attention by using notifications and alerts. it is far too common to "" �get lost scrolling""� the same way you "" �get lost in a book""�. nearly everyone you ask will have experiences of laying in bed and scrolling a social media platform for too long pointlessly. conclusion exponential growth in technology has made the world a better place. since it is so beneficial to us as society, we tend to overlook the bad habits which we have formed using a now widely available world wide web. as everything else in nature, we need time to adjust to rapid changes and adapt. educating our children as early as possible on how to properly use the "" �tool""� of the internet is vital for them to form good habits. . references [1] datareportal, "" �digital around the

24,7,1251,"semi structured perspective piece. "" �interdependency of culture, society and technological innovation""� selected topic. mass transit for high density living and their limitation due to pandemics. abstract this paper investigates surveys done australia wide on the effect of the covid 19 pandemic on the use of public transport in areas of high density. some ideas that will be considered questioned are the effects of the waves of covid 19 that australia (its major cities) experienced and how that affects the day to day use of public transport. the restrictions that were put in place and how the easing of these restrictions posed concerns about hygiene and spreading of the virus outside of our homes, particularly creating negative correlations when it came to the use public transport. 1 introduction this paper analyses the use of public transport and stigma around using public transport after covid 19 hit australia. as january 2020 began so did the increasing worry of australians to the virus albeit very slowly until the virus landed on our shores and the infections numbers started to skyrocket in major cities. the  1.1. covid 19 in australia covid 19 in the first year in australia came in three waves between the dates. wave 1. 27 jan 1 july 2020 wave 2. 2 july 7 december 2020 wave 3. 14 december 30 december 2020 australia's response to covid 19 as a whole was remarkably better than most other countries (as at 8 september 2020) with a recorded 29 deaths per million people [1], almost four times lower than the global average of 114 deaths per million people. australia has recorded 1030 cases per million people since the start of the year [2]. although australia has done a better job compared to other countries in handling the effects and trying to flatten the curve of covid 19. they have had their own hardships to face and over come to create a new normal that they could get used to. a huge hurdle that came about with covid 19 was the use of public transport in major cities throughout australia figure 1 shows the mobility trends collected by apple mobility data for the year 2020. this data clearly shows a decline in the middle of march 2020 as the stay at home orders were put in affect. driving and walking modes increased to and almost to their original usage by june but with the second wave starting around then and new stay at home orders being put in place and the extended lock downs in victoria. public transport never fully recovered, remaining steady from june to october. all modes started to increase towards the end of the year with easing of restrictions and lockdowns being lifted until the third wave hit and all modes declined again. it is evident from figure 1 [3] that transit had declined usage compared to the same time the year before with over 30 000 less trips per day. of em driving =<<.transit walking figure 1 .  2. effects of covid 19 on day to day use of public transport by the australian people from the household impacts of covid 19 surveys done in march 2021 for the year 2020, figure 2 shows how weekly travel has changed before and during the three waves of covid 19 in australia for car and public transport (pt) for those living in high

due to factors other than lockdowns and stay at home orders put into place by the government. office workers in these high density areas of sydney and melbourne were offered told to work from home a few or all days of the week to reduce the spread of covid 19 as well as adhering to the requests of those who work in large office building who do not feel comfortable going in to work. figure 3 [4]

figure 3 .  3. how the restrictions pose concerns about hygiene and spreading of the virus outside of the home the restrictions that were implemented to both sydney and melbourne included social distancing, mask wearing, lockdowns and stay at home orders (business school closures). with these restrictions in place the people living in the restricted areas who were working for essential services (police, hospital workers, food delivery personnel, supermarket workers, etc.) were still able to leave home to go to and from the workplace. all others were encouraged or forced to work from home. as of september 2020, one in 11 people had used pt one or more times a week for that month compared to one on 4 before the outbreak in march 2020 [5]. figure 4 [6] shows the modes of transport that were least and most comfortable for australians in metropolitan areas as of july 2020. least comfortable most comfortable of walk bicycle . ll 11% taxi ride hail figure 4 .  4. conclusion the conclusion goes through major trends seen during the three waves experienced in 2020 due to covid 19. a range of different factors influenced the use of public transport by people living in high density areas mainly due to the restrictions put in place by the governing bodies to flatten the curve of covid 19 and to allow a shorter turn around time to the normal they were all used to. after restrictions were eased, we could see the trend of not returning to public transport in affect as people did not feel as comfortable as using their own mode of transport to make their trips. what can be seen is that people were not in a major rush to start working from home but those that did influenced the return to public transport in a big way as from the data collected it was clearly shown that the use of public transport never fully recovered. high density areas were the focus of this paper, and it has been shown that public transport has taken the biggest downfall due to the pandemic.

18,73,982,"sydney metro. the cultural, environmental and technological vicissitude of rail transit 1. abstract this sociotechnical essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the sydney metro project on the city s culture, environment and technological innovation 2. introduction being habited by approximately 5.3 million people, the sprawled city of sydney faces a great demand for efficient, accessible and reliable means of public transport. an engineering solution to respond to the growing demands faces many challenges to enable mass travelling and commuting around the city while minimising any detriment to the city's historical and cultural landmarks. on 14 november 2016, a 30.8 billion dollar infrastructure project was announced to implement a driverless, underground electric train network to connect sydney's central business district to its suburbs [1], while interfacing with the current train facilities already under operation. although australia's first completely automated metro rail system will prove itself to be an engineering feat, increasing sydney's rail capacity by up to 60 per cent by 2024 [1], the societal, environmental and cultural impacts of this project should be investigated. will the metro system transform sydney into the economical forefront of australia? or will the quintessence heritage of the city be lost in the process? 3. impacts of the sydney metro project 3.1. congestion removal in sydney cbd public transport is a fundamental element in the functionality of modern society within a city. with the average person in sydney spending 46 minutes commuting to and from work every day, rail transit holds huge pressure to provide fast and efficient travel around the city. in particular, sydney faces a congestion issue in its travel into the city's southwest, as the bankstown line shares platform allocations with the airport line and the inner west line, causing delays as trains are halted until platforms become available. the city southwest portion of the metro project aims to rectify this issue, implementing two new platforms at central station as the metro line will replace the .  existing bankstown line, freeing the bottleneck congestion occurring at central [2]. the following diagram provided by transport nsw illustrates the plan to remove the congestion. sydney's rail congestion a railway network

at central station sydney metro will showcase australia's first driverless train, an innovative marvel both nation and worldwide. a metro transit operated by effective programs will remove chances of unexpected delays, as trains will be expected to run every four minutes [1]. new south wales has recently experienced a series of union strikes staged by train drivers, causing delays and infrequent train arrival times. an article published by the guardian stated that the rail industry worker s union wishes to "" �exceed the government s 3% cap on annual public sector wage rises""� [3]. a driverless train will automate the operation of these trains, removing the possibility of commuters experiencing disruptions due to union strikes. however, the driverless train will also remove jobs as train drivers, putting many train drivers out of work long term. . ) 3.3. reinstatement of henry lawson reserve large infrastructure projects are often responsible for the destruction of many environmental ecosystems and produce large carbon footprints. however, the contractors delivering the sydney metro have incorporated recreational facilities into the design of the railway. for example, the focal parkland of blues point, henry lawson reserve, was demolished to provide a temporary access route for the tunnel boring machine in the cbd section of the metro line [4]. this removes such an important environmental ecosystem and societal landmark from the city. however, this park was reinstated with new greenery and a spectacular view of the sydney harbour upon completion of the tunnel boring works in the project. 3.4. demolition of cultural landmarks to implement the new underground stations, many sites around sydney have been closed down, demolished and replaced by the new metro stations. although the new stations will improve the accessibility of the metro transit to the public, an important part of sydney s culture will be lost. for example, to make way for

7,63,1128,"the future of decentralised workforces abstract. the recent growth of telecom technologies heralds a rapid decentralisation of workforces across many global industries. several new and emerging telecom platforms were forced to run a trial by fire during the recent global pandemic and have revolutionised how business is run since. this large exposure to these technologies was born out of necessity with the pandemic, but through the advantages that were made apparent, it is clear that they are here to stay. while these telecom technologies have had their fair share of growing pains as with all emerging technologies, for many people, the advantages out way any negatives. a key advantage from these technologies is the acceptance and utilization of working from home. as this becomes more normalised, it will no longer be necessary to commute to work every day. a decentralised workforce has pros and cons for both employers and employees. this paper explores the implications of a decentralised workforce on our society and draws insights into the interdependency of social and technological innovation. introduction. the recent covid 19 global pandemic severely impacted many businesses globally. frequent lockdowns and outbreaks meant that many people were not allowed to leave their house, let alone go to their place of work. to stay afloat with these extenuating circumstances, businesses had to rapidly adapt, otherwise they would quickly run out of money. a number of telecom technologies were utilised by businesses where employees were able to work from home. some of the most popular businesses that were used were zoom, microsoft teams, and google meets. it quickly became apparent that workers were able to work as efficiently from home as they were the office, all while eliminating the need to commute to work. it was found that by may 202, 46% of nsw workers were able to work from home. [1] the time save from commuting alone had a drastic societal impact on the quality of life for the average worker. after a new normal was established post covid, businesses were able to allow their employees back into the office. after the success of working from home, not all workers were so accepting of commuting to work every day if they could work just as well from home. due to a societal push, working from home was becoming more of a normalised option, even if it was not specifically required. due to the available telecom technologies, workers were able to live further and further away from their place of work. employers were also able to access and ever expanding pool of potential employees as they were no longer geographically bound in their decision making. despite its challenges, | believe that rise of decentralised workforces due to emerging telecom technology is a net benefit for society. page 1 of 4 october 2022 . body. one of the main hesitations from working from home is the assumption that workers will be less productive than if they were working from an office. in practice, the opposite of this was found, as in nsw, working from home had a 1.9% boost to productivity during the covid 19 pandemic. [3] as per figure 1 below, 86% of nsw workers self assessed that they were equally or more productive when working from home. this is in clear contrast to the expectations of most employers before the pandemic. | believe that once this became obvious to employers, one of the last hurdles from normalising working from home was overcome. oo managers moteable workers re less productive equally productive more productive remoteable workers assessment managers assessment of their of their own productivity when remote remote staff s productivity figure 1. nsw workers self assessed and manager assessed productivity when working from home source. ipc remote working survey [1] another potential worry that employers had was that workers were going to experience â€˜zoom fatigue'. this is where a worker experiences a burnout from only interacting with their colleagues and work virtually from a screen. this however was not the case, as only a quarter of workers say that they are worn out by it according to jan 2022 pew research center survey. [2] not having to commute into work every day had a significant impact on general wellbeing and quality of life for the average worker during the pandemic. in just the greater sydney metropolitan area alone, it is estimated that in 2020, $5.6 billion was saved in annual travel time costs. [4] this figure is quite significant in shared saving across workers. as working from home became more accepted, even outside of the pandemic, workers were more likely to purchase a home further from their place of work. in the netherlands, it was found that page 2 of 4 october 2022 . people would accept a 5% longer commute on average when working from home. [5] we can see in figure 2 that even in australia, people were starting to purchase cheaper houses further away from urban centres as working from home became more viable. a. houses b. units 20 20 nl ll "" �wal +5 nsw vic qid sa wa tas nt act nsw vic qid sa wa tas nt act =capital city @regional figure 2. house property values, capital cities vs regional, australia, march 2020 ""�� march 2021 act and nt regional units values unavailable. source. corelogic (2021) [6] we can see that there is a large uptick in regional house and unit sales compared to the equivalent increase in australia's capital cities. this is further proof of a decentralised workforce as a result of the pandemic and societies use of telecom technologies to continue to work effectively. conclusion. in conclusion, | believe that the decentralisation of our workforce because of emerging telecom technologies has been largely beneficial on our society. from an increase in productivity, to the savings in time and money due to less reliance on commuting to work, the benefits are numerous. a further acceptance of working from home will only increase the benefits in my opinion. page 3 of 4 october 2022 . reference list.

12,32,2213,"the improvement of telecom technology leads to the rise of decentralised workforces during pandemics. abstract introduction with the worldwide spread of the covid19, the majority of humanity's interactions were moved online. facilitated by already existing telecom technologies such as zoom and skype, this humanitarian catastrophe allowed for the trial of a new workforce system. this technology already existed as far as a decade before the pandemic on several platforms however it was mostly used as a social tool and was not globally considered as a medium of any significance to corporate entities as it is now today. the effects of the devastating pandemic were rather promising for the common men and women of the work force and had noticeable complex effects on all other facets of life. the improvements in telecom technology provides our society with the opportunity to usher in a new workforce era. the introduction of such has the ability to affect every aspect of life from mental health, sleep, social activity and the distribution of the population and economy across the country. there is the possibility of positive and negative outcomes, but the ratio of such will be partly determined by those sitting at the top of the corporate hierarchy, and whether this technology will be corrupted and used for the advancement of the workforce, or for the degradation of such. this paper was written in order to contribute to the understanding of the effects of remote work, and its impact on peoples economy and productivity. the paper will evaluate and provide a personal perspective of the writer, derived from cited statistics and papers, infused with individual experience and perceptions of the world around us. within this perceptive essay, the writer aims to examine positive and negative effects of the way telecom technology has changed the world around us through online work, and to suggest possible solutions for the issues that come with it. likely the most intuitive product of working from home is the increased amount of time an individual has available to his or herself. primarily this is from the elimination of the commuting time typically allocated within a given work day. in the study of milner et al . perspective essay (2017), it is stated "" �australians spent an average of 5 hours per week commuting in 2009""� with outliers being as notably high as 20 hours a week. with the adoption of online work, our workforces have the potential to dramatically slash these figures. this would be an absolute positive given there has been a direct relationship drawn between commute times and employee sleep problems, as illustrated in the study of halonen et al 2019, who state "" �among those with longer than normal working hours, the odds of physical inactivity and sleep problems were increased if commuting time was >5 vs 1 5 hours week""�. this same study also found that commuting had a negative effect on problem drinking in men, specifically "" �when commuting time was >5 vs 1 5 hours week, the age adjusted effect estimate for problem drinking was positive (or 1.25, 95% cl 0.65 to 2.41) for men""�. evidently, higher commuting times correlate to a decrease in generalised wellbeing that commonly manifests itself through symptoms of insomnia and alcoholism. however, it is important to note that halonen et al (2019) are basing their findings off of an average commute time greater than 5 hours per week, there is a minority of the population that commute less than 2hrs a week. this minority is likely to not experience as significant improvements from the introduction of online work. for most individuals however it is unsurprising that the decrease of commute times has a positive effect on mental health, given how by nature we crave meaningful experiences, particularly ones that are centred around interpersonal experience and physical exertion. these make up the very foundation of the human experience. commuters having more time to exercise, cook and engage with children and spouses, which in tum creates a more authentic human experience and allows their lives to be dictated less by work. this dramatic change is not possible without the advent of advanced telecom technology that we have available to us today. despite many positive effects as a result of the telecom technology and online work, some individuals are affected negatively by the blurred borders between work and home. within the traditional system, individuals may travel a long distance and experience an obvious, clear change in environment among other cues which helped them unwind. typically, the physical removal of ones presence from the work space meant that, for the most part, work stayed at work. within the study undertaken by felstead and henseke (2017), it is stated that "" �around a third (36.0 per cent) of conventionally sited workers kept worrying about job problems ... but among remote workers the proportion facing these difficulties was eight percentage (44%) points higher. this increase, though significant, fortunately does not encompass the majority of the population of online workers. a similar study then suggests . perspective essay that â€˜it is argued that this is more difficult where the borders between home and work are intentionally blurred (clark, 2000). these issues raised in clark's study (2000) is one that is an example of individuals purposely abusing the reach that telecom technology has on their fellow employee subordinate. this is further echoed however without the assumption of maliciousness within the study of giurge and bohns (2020), who state that within â€˜five studies involving more than 2000 working adults, we found that senders of after hours work emails underestimate how compelled receivers feel to respond right away, even when such emails are not urgent""�. this erosion of the borders between work and personal life are most likely a result of not having correct preparation, education and union support throughout the rushed transition to online work during the pandemic. playing catch up with the issue of working outside hours australian unions have recently proposed a â€˜right to disconnect as part of employment agreements. this is a first step in the right direction to a world where online work can function at optimum. the above listed negatives may be remedied from a combination of changing employer and employee attitudes. while various unions are the most effective way to prevent employers exploiting the technology, the individual must be educated. for the effects of being unable to unwind and relax from work, a possible cbt therapy might be useful in extreme cases, however simply creating rules and designated spaces (if possible) would be extremely useful in creating a sort of cue to one's mind that work is finished for the day. for many employees, the rushed move to remote working revealed that working from home limits small social interactions with a varied group of individuals, whether it simply be idle chatting, or more emotional attachment. online employees found they missed out on a degree of community. this was touched in particularly by the eurofound and the international labour office [6] who state "" �one of the most problematic aspects of mobile work seems to be isolation""�. the same study cited that 62 percent of teleworkers reported feeling that they had "" �less interaction with friends""�. this is particularly interesting however it is unsurprising. perceptively, it appears as though this is not only a product of the rushed move to online work, but more notably it seems to be a conflict between the telecom technology and modern city culture. pre industrial revolution, the city contained nowhere near the proportions of people, considering a far greater number of jobs were agriculturally based, meaning the population was more spread out. thus, small communities thrived and was a large part of standard social diet. small communities were always an essential foundation of human interaction and existence, creating a social backbone and a necessary . perspective essay part of survival, doubling as means of trade. countless studies have documented a direct proportion between mental wellbeing and sense of community belonging, with a study completed by michalski et al (2020) stating that "" �weaker community belonging exhibited an association with both poorer general and mental health, though a stronger association was observed with mental health""�. today's modern world has a more blurred sense of community which for most is heavily intertwined with the corporate life and all its variables. intuitively, it appears the remedy for this is to extradite community and unbind it from its current corporate entities. a return to smaller, closer and more traditionally human communities would not only alleviate the loneliness of online work but would remedy an already existing situation that is a result of city life. this community would likely be something that would exist mostly outside the workspace. telecom technology unexpectedly brought corporate community dynamic to forefront of everyone's minds, and the trouble comes with putting too much reliance on it being a sole source of community and belonging. the widespread adoption of online work through the use of telecom technology has had far reaching effects, dispersing populations into smaller communities and in turn effecting economies and housing prices. since the widespread inceptions of online work, rural towns have experience significant economic changes and have the possibility of being part of a large cultural shift. with typical models centred around working in cbd economic centres, there has existed a relationship where the further the commute distance from the cbd, the lower the housing prices. country towns have seen a massive increase in house prices, economic magnitude, and population growth due to an influx of people. this is primarily caused by a large exodus of individuals that, given the state of telecom technology, are no longer required to attend in person work within city cbds. this trend has had the inverse effect on city economic centres business which have seen less business. the symptoms of the effects are obvious in many different areas, one of which is vacancy rates within cbd commercial property. . perspective essay commercial real estate vacancy rates in australian cbds 25 data collected since onset of the pandemic

it is most likely the culmination of a multitude of factors, this evidence does show that, due to employees no longer needing to visit cbd areas for work, they contain much of their spending to areas surrounding their residence. examining this symptom, the australian government productivity commission (2021) suggests that "" �as more people begin to work from home, businesses that have relied on commuters spending money in cbds will face lower demand. this creates potential for some business activity to move away from city centres in search of the more spatially diffuse market for goods and
